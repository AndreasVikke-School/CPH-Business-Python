“TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah
Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open
which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £ 4 a week for purely
nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above
the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven
o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope’s
Court, Fleet Street.”

“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I
do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say nothing of
the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under
the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”

“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning
as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was
perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather
fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the
<i>Encyclopædia</i>, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the
way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,
really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt
suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his
accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and
what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the
advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the
man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every
morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come
for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for
securing the situation.”

<p>
“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr.
Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man
who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the
Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother
carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her
sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They
got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as
father could have got if he had been alive.”



113869, 114148, 114155 
<p>
“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw
so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no
doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a
single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”



210295, 211001, 211049 
<p>
“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your
patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from
which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face
downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.
There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that
the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of
‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of
death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet
it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the
estate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”



249552, 249609, 250040 
<p>
“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every
poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap
on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never
to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two
forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was
answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle
of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.

“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to
Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of
money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived
generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and
in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two
children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and
went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of
temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is
popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present
moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10<i>s</i>.,
while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.
There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing
upon his mind.

“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at
£ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face
with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a
long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I
threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first
chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers.
Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to
lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar
and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This
fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my
secret was safe in his possession.

“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I
do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700 a
year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional
advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which
improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All
day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very
bad day in which I failed to take £ 2.

“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have
read the advertisement about it in <i>The Times</i> every day lately. It is
absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward
offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market
price.”

“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink
’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a
bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of
him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn
from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I
fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be
determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or
whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly
fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the
matter, and I should—”

“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the
young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia
and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my
mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less
than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while
we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be
allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to
England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway
accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish
himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral
house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our
wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To
determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices
of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the
time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through the
fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim an
income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both
girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one
of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has
not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too
serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are
interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab
and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your
revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with
gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I
think, all that we need.”

“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a
dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have
had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my
profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to £ 27 10<i>s</i>. Every
day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my
little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I
should never have any practice at all.

“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I
should have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten
times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business
and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily
understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’

“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling
for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes. When I was alone
once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me,
I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which
it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national
possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to
it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it
was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and
turned once more to my work.

“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he
answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for
any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in
the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of
his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could
possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor
would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.
This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the
police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill
in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at
present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
necessary. I have already offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do!
I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I
do!”

them?”

there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen.

“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and
changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw
that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute
a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him.
At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular
that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the
wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he
could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would
give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out
the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’
said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I
soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him
that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering
I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him
that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after
what I may call a really hard day’s work.”

the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history

“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough
in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself
whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had
strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they
were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in
England are getting £ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many
people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the
number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the
day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back
to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this
letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:

“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your
decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much
attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £
120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads
may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a
particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress
indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing
one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia),
which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or
there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no
inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I
could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid
that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased
salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is
concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the
dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,
