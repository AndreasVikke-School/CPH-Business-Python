<h1>His Last Bow</h1>

<h2>by Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>
The friends of Mr. Sherlock Holmes will be glad to learn that he is still alive
and well, though somewhat crippled by occasional attacks of rheumatism. He
has, for many years, lived in a small farm upon the Downs five miles from
Eastbourne, where his time is divided between philosophy and agriculture.
During this period of rest he has refused the most princely offers to take up
various cases, having determined that his retirement was a permanent one. The
approach of the German war caused him, however, to lay his remarkable
combination of intellectual and practical activity at the disposal of the
Government, with historical results which are recounted in <i>His Last Bow</i>.
Several previous experiences which have lain long in my portfolio have been
added to <i>His Last Bow</i> so as to complete the volume.

<h4><a name="chap08"></a> 1. The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott
Eccles</h4>

<p>
I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the
end of March in the year 1892. Holmes had received a telegram while we sat at
our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He made no remark, but the matter
remained in his thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a
thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the
message. Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;How do you define the word &lsquo;grotesque&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strange&mdash;remarkable,&rdquo; I suggested.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head at my definition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is surely something more than that,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;some
underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind
back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering
public, you will recognise how often the grotesque has deepened into the
criminal. Think of that little affair of the red-headed men. That was grotesque
enough in the outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or,
again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led
straight to a murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you it there?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
He read the telegram aloud.
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience. May I consult
you?<br/><br/>
&ldquo;Scott Eccles,<br/>
&ldquo;Post Office, Charing Cross.&rdquo;
</p>

<br/>

<p>
&ldquo;Man or woman?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram. She
would have come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you see him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up
Colonel Carruthers. My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces
because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built. Life is
commonplace, the papers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to have passed
forever from the criminal world. Can you ask me, then, whether I am ready to
look into any new problem, however trivial it may prove? But here, unless I am
mistaken, is our client.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout, tall,
grey-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room. His
life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner. From his
spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a churchman, a good
citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. But some amazing
experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his
bristling hair, his flushed, angry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He
plunged instantly into his business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. It is
most improper&mdash;most outrageous. I must insist upon some
explanation.&rdquo; He swelled and puffed in his anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,&rdquo; said Holmes in a soothing voice.
&ldquo;May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police,
and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I could not leave
it where it was. Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no
sympathy, but none the less, having heard your name&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so. But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes glanced at his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a quarter-past two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your telegram was
dispatched about one. But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without
seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was
only too glad to get out of such a house. But I have been running round making
inquiries before I came to you. I went to the house agents, you know, and they
said that Mr. Garcia&rsquo;s rent was paid up all right and that everything was
in order at Wisteria Lodge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, sir,&rdquo; said Holmes, laughing. &ldquo;You are like my
friend, Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end
foremost. Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence,
exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt,
with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of advice and
assistance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware
that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before. But I will tell
you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am
sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside, and Mrs.
Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and official-looking individuals,
one of whom was well known to us as Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an
energetic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer. He shook
hands with Holmes and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey
Constabulary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our trail lay in this
direction.&rdquo; He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor. &ldquo;Are you
Mr. John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have been following you about all the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent at Charing Cross Post-Office
and came on here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why do you follow me? What do you want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up to
the death last night of Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near
Esher.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour struck from
his astonished face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dead? Did you say he was dead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, he is dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how? An accident?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God! This is awful! You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean
that I am suspected?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A letter of yours was found in the dead man&rsquo;s pocket, and we know
by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you did, did you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Out came the official notebook.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a bit, Gregson,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;All you desire
is a plain statement, is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used against
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room. I
think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I suggest that
you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and that you proceed with
your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been
interrupted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face.
With a dubious glance at the inspector&rsquo;s notebook, he plunged at once
into his extraordinary statement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a bachelor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and being of a sociable turn I
cultivate a large number of friends. Among these are the family of a retired
brewer called Melville, living at Abermarle Mansion, Kensington. It was at his
table that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He was, I
understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the embassy. He
spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and as good-looking a man
as ever I saw in my life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I. He
seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of our meeting
he came to see me at Lee. One thing led to another, and it ended in his
inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher
and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had described his household to me before I went there. He lived with
a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all his needs.
This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for him. Then there
was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up in his
travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. I remember that he remarked what
a queer household it was to find in the heart of Surrey, and that I agreed with
him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I drove to the place&mdash;about two miles on the south side of Esher.
The house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving
drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs. It was an old, tumbledown
building in a crazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled up on the
grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and weather-stained door, I had
doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly. He opened the
door himself, however, and greeted me with a great show of cordiality. I was
handed over to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the
way, my bag in his hand, to my bedroom. The whole place was depressing. Our
dinner was <i>tête-à-tête</i>, and though my host did his best to be
entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so
vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him. He continually drummed
his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous
impatience. The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked, and the
gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us. I can
assure you that many times in the course of the evening I wished that I could
invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the
business that you two gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of it at
the time. Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the servant. I noticed
that after my host had read it he seemed even more distrait and strange than
before. He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat, smoking endless
cigarettes, lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents.
About eleven I was glad to go to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my
door&mdash;the room was dark at the time&mdash;and asked me if I had rung. I
said that I had not. He apologised for having disturbed me so late, saying that
it was nearly one o&rsquo;clock. I dropped off after this and slept soundly all
night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now I come to the amazing part of my tale. When I woke it was broad
daylight. I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I had
particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much astonished at this
forgetfulness. I sprang up and rang for the servant. There was no response. I
rang again and again, with the same result. Then I came to the conclusion that
the bell was out of order. I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an
exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water. You can imagine my surprise
when I found that there was no one there. I shouted in the hall. There was no
answer. Then I ran from room to room. All were deserted. My host had shown me
which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door. No reply. I
turned the handle and walked in. The room was empty, and the bed had never been
slept in. He had gone with the rest. The foreign host, the foreign footman, the
foreign cook, all had vanished in the night! That was the end of my visit to
Wisteria Lodge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this bizarre
incident to his collection of strange episodes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;May I ask, sir, what you did then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was furious. My first idea was that I had been the victim of some
absurd practical joke. I packed my things, banged the hall door behind me, and
set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan Brothers&rsquo;,
the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was from this firm that
the villa had been rented. It struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly
be for the purpose of making a fool of me, and that the main object must be to
get out of the rent. It is late in March, so quarter-day is at hand. But this
theory would not work. The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me
that the rent had been paid in advance. Then I made my way to town and called
at the Spanish embassy. The man was unknown there. After this I went to see
Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he really
knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I got your reply to my wire
I came out to you, since I gather that you are a person who gives advice in
difficult cases. But now, Mr. Inspector, I understand, from what you said when
you entered the room, that you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy
had occurred. I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth, and
that, outside of what I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate
of this man. My only desire is to help the law in every possible way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles&mdash;I am sure of it,&rdquo; said
Inspector Gregson in a very amiable tone. &ldquo;I am bound to say that
everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have
come to our notice. For example, there was that note which arrived during
dinner. Did you chance to observe what became of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I did. Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only redeemed
from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost hidden behind the
heavy creases of cheek and brow. With a slow smile he drew a folded and
discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it. I picked this out
unburned from the back of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes smiled his appreciation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet
of paper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did, Mr. Holmes. It&rsquo;s my way. Shall I read it, Mr.
Gregson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Londoner nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark. It
is a quarter-sheet. The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-bladed
scissors. It has been folded over three times and sealed with purple wax, put
on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval object. It is addressed to
Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair,
first corridor, seventh right, green baize. Godspeed. D.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a woman&rsquo;s writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the
address is either done with another pen or by someone else. It is thicker and
bolder, as you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A very remarkable note,&rdquo; said Holmes, glancing it over. &ldquo;I
must compliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your
examination of it. A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The oval seal
is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link&mdash;what else is of such a shape? The
scissors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips are, you can
distinctly see the same slight curve in each.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The country detective chuckled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was a
little over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to say that I make nothing
of the note except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as usual
was at the bottom of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has
happened to Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As to Garcia,&rdquo; said Gregson, &ldquo;that is easily answered. He
was found dead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home.
His head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such
instrument, which had crushed rather than wounded. It is a lonely corner, and
there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot. He had apparently
been struck down first from behind, but his assailant had gone on beating him
long after he was dead. It was a most furious assault. There are no footsteps
nor any clue to the criminals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Robbed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, there was no attempt at robbery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is very painful&mdash;very painful and terrible,&rdquo; said Mr.
Scott Eccles in a querulous voice, &ldquo;but it is really uncommonly hard on
me. I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and
meeting so sad an end. How do I come to be mixed up with the case?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very simply, sir,&rdquo; Inspector Baynes answered. &ldquo;The only
document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that
you would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of this
letter which gave us the dead man&rsquo;s name and address. It was after nine
this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else
inside it. I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I examined
Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town, joined Mr. Gregson, and here we
are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think now,&rdquo; said Gregson, rising, &ldquo;we had best put this
matter into an official shape. You will come round with us to the station, Mr.
Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain your services, Mr. Holmes.
I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My friend turned to the country inspector.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr.
Baynes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you
have done. Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the man met
his death?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had been there since one o&rsquo;clock. There was rain about that
time, and his death had certainly been before the rain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,&rdquo; cried our client.
&ldquo;His voice is unmistakable. I could swear to it that it was he who
addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remarkable, but by no means impossible,&rdquo; said Holmes, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a clue?&rdquo; asked Gregson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it
certainly presents some novel and interesting features. A further knowledge of
facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final and definite opinion.
By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything remarkable besides this note in
your examination of the house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The detective looked at my friend in a singular way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There were,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one or two <i>very</i> remarkable
things. Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station you would care to
come out and give me your opinion of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am entirely at your service,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the
bell. &ldquo;You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send
the boy with this telegram. He is to pay a five-shilling reply.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes smoked
hard, with his brows drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head thrust
forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Watson,&rdquo; he asked, turning suddenly upon me, &ldquo;what do
you make of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the crime?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, taken with the disappearance of the man&rsquo;s companions, I
should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from
justice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is certainly a possible point of view. On the face of it you must
admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should have been
in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when
he had a guest. They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the
week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why did they fly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact. Another big fact is the
remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear Watson, is it
beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would
cover both of these big facts? If it were one which would also admit of the
mysterious note with its very curious phraseology, why, then it would be worth
accepting as a temporary hypothesis. If the fresh facts which come to our
knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually
become a solution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what is our hypothesis?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible.
There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of Scott
Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what possible connection?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us take it link by link. There is, on the face of it, something
unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard
and Scott Eccles. It was the former who forced the pace. He called upon Eccles
at the other end of London on the very day after he first met him, and he kept
in close touch with him until he got him down to Esher. Now, what did he want
with Eccles? What could Eccles supply? I see no charm in the man. He is not
particularly intelligent&mdash;not a man likely to be congenial to a
quick-witted Latin. Why, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom
Garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose? Has he any one outstanding
quality? I say that he has. He is the very type of conventional British
respectability, and the very man as a witness to impress another Briton. You
saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his
statement, extraordinary as it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what was he to witness?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another way.
That is how I read the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see, he might have proved an alibi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi. We will suppose,
for argument&rsquo;s sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are
confederates in some design. The attempt, whatever it may be, is to come off,
we will say, before one o&rsquo;clock. By some juggling of the clocks it is
quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he
thought, but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to
tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve. If Garcia could do
whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a
powerful reply to any accusation. Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready
to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time. It
was an insurance against the worst.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I see that. But how about the disappearance of the
others?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any
insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data.
You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the message?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did it run? &lsquo;Our own colours, green and white.&rsquo; Sounds
like racing. &lsquo;Green open, white shut.&rsquo; That is clearly a signal.
&lsquo;Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.&rsquo; This is
an assignation. We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all. It was
clearly a dangerous quest. She would not have said &lsquo;Godspeed&rsquo; had
it not been so. &lsquo;D&rsquo;&mdash;that should be a guide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man was a Spaniard. I suggest that &lsquo;D&rsquo; stands for
Dolores, a common female name in Spain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good, Watson, very good&mdash;but quite inadmissable. A Spaniard would
write to a Spaniard in Spanish. The writer of this note is certainly English.
Well, we can only possess our soul in patience until this excellent inspector
come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us
for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
An answer had arrived to Holmes&rsquo;s telegram before our Surrey officer had
returned. Holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook when he
caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are moving in exalted circles,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
The telegram was a list of names and addresses:
</p>

<p>
Lord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr. Hynes
Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton Old Hall; Mr.
Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,&rdquo;
said Holmes. &ldquo;No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already
adopted some similar plan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that the
message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation. Now,
if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in order to keep the tryst one has
to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor, it is perfectly
clear that the house is a very large one. It is equally certain that this house
cannot be more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in
that direction and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back in
Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid
up to one o&rsquo;clock. As the number of large houses close to Oxshott must be
limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by
Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them. Here they are in this telegram, and
the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
It was nearly six o&rsquo;clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey
village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.
</p>

<p>
Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable quarters at
the Bull. Finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to
Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March evening, with a sharp wind and a fine
rain beating upon our faces, a fit setting for the wild common over which our
road passed and the tragic goal to which it led us.
</p>

<h4><a name="chap09"></a>2. The Tiger of San Pedro</h4>

<p>
A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden
gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The curved and shadowed
drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky.
From the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a
feeble light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a constable in possession,&rdquo; said Baynes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll knock at the window.&rdquo; He stepped across the grass plot
and tapped with his hand on the pane. Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a
man spring up from a chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within
the room. An instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened
the door, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Walters?&rdquo; asked Baynes sharply.
</p>

<p>
The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh of
relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you have come, sir. It has been a long evening, and I
don&rsquo;t think my nerve is as good as it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your nerve, Walters? I should not have thought you had a nerve in your
body.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, it&rsquo;s this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in
the kitchen. Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That what had come again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The devil, sir, for all I know. It was at the window.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was at the window, and when?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was just about two hours ago. The light was just fading. I was
sitting reading in the chair. I don&rsquo;t know what made me look up, but
there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. Lord, sir, what a
face it was! I&rsquo;ll see it in my dreams.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tut, tut, Walters. This is not talk for a police-constable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and there&rsquo;s no use to
deny it. It wasn&rsquo;t black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I
know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it. Then
there was the size of it&mdash;it was twice yours, sir. And the look of
it&mdash;the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a
hungry beast. I tell you, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t move a finger, nor get my
breath, till it whisked away and was gone. Out I ran and through the shrubbery,
but thank God there was no one there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a
black mark against you for this. If it were the devil himself a constable on
duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him. I suppose
the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That, at least, is very easily settled,&rdquo; said Holmes, lighting his
little pocket lantern. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he reported, after a short
examination of the grass bed, &ldquo;a number twelve shoe, I should say. If he
was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a
giant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What became of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the
road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face,
&ldquo;whoever he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he&rsquo;s
gone for the present, and we have more immediate things to attend to. Now, Mr.
Holmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search.
Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them, and all the
furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house. A
good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co., High Holborn, had been
left behind. Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx
knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer. Odds and ends, some
pipes, a few novels, two of them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pinfire revolver,
and a guitar were among the personal property.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing in all this,&rdquo; said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from
room to room. &ldquo;But now, Mr. Holmes, I invite your attention to the
kitchen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a straw
litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the cook. The table
was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates, the <i>débris</i> of last
night&rsquo;s dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; said Baynes. &ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the back of
the dresser. It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that it was difficult
to say what it might have been. One could but say that it was black and
leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a dwarfish, human figure. At
first, as I examined it, I thought that it was a mummified negro baby, and then
it seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey. Finally I was left in doubt as to
whether it was animal or human. A double band of white shells were strung round
the centre of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very interesting&mdash;very interesting, indeed!&rdquo; said Holmes,
peering at this sinister relic. &ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle. The
limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces with the
feathers still on, were littered all over it. Holmes pointed to the wattles on
the severed head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A white cock,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Most interesting! It is really a
very curious case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last. From under the
sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood. Then from the
table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something has been killed and something has been burned. We raked all
these out of the fire. We had a doctor in this morning. He says that they are
not human.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must congratulate you, Inspector, on handling so distinctive and
instructive a case. Your powers, if I may say so without offence, seem superior
to your opportunities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Inspector Baynes&rsquo;s small eyes twinkled with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Mr. Holmes. We stagnate in the provinces. A case of
this sort gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it. What do you
make of these bones?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lamb, I should say, or a kid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the white cock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curious, Mr. Baynes, very curious. I should say almost unique.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, there must have been some very strange people with some very
strange ways in this house. One of them is dead. Did his companions follow him
and kill him? If they did we should have them, for every port is watched. But
my own views are different. Yes, sir, my own views are very different.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a theory then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll work it myself, Mr. Holmes. It&rsquo;s only due to my own
credit to do so. Your name is made, but I have still to make mine. I should be
glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your
help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes laughed good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, Inspector,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you follow your path
and I will follow mine. My results are always very much at your service if you
care to apply to me for them. I think that I have seen all that I wish in this
house, and that my time may be more profitably employed elsewhere. <i>Au
revoir</i> and good luck!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I could tell by numerous subtle signs, which might have been lost upon anyone
but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent. As impassive as ever to the casual
observer, there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of
tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the
game was afoot. After his habit he said nothing, and after mine I asked no
questions. Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the
capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption. All
would come round to me in due time.
</p>

<p>
I waited, therefore&mdash;but to my ever-deepening disappointment I waited in
vain. Day succeeded day, and my friend took no step forward. One morning he
spent in town, and I learned from a casual reference that he had visited the
British Museum. Save for this one excursion, he spent his days in long and
often solitary walks, or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose
acquaintance he had cultivated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to
you,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It is very pleasant to see the first green
shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again. With a spud, a
tin box, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days to be
spent.&rdquo; He prowled about with this equipment himself, but it was a poor
show of plants which he would bring back of an evening.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes. His fat, red face
wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my
companion. He said little about the case, but from that little we gathered that
he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events. I must admit, however,
that I was somewhat surprised when, some five days after the crime, I opened my
morning paper to find in large letters:
</p>

<p class="center">
THE OXSHOTT MYSTERY<br/>
A SOLUTION<br/>
ARREST OF SUPPOSED ASSASSIN
</p>

<p>
Holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the headlines.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that Baynes has
got him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; said I as I read the following report:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district when
it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection
with the Oxshott murder. It will be remembered that Mr. Garcia, of Wisteria
Lodge, was found dead on Oxshott Common, his body showing signs of extreme
violence, and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled, which
appeared to show their participation in the crime. It was suggested, but never
proved, that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house, and
that their abstraction was the motive of the crime. Every effort was made by
Inspector Baynes, who has the case in hand, to ascertain the hiding place of
the fugitives, and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but
were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared. It was certain
from the first, however, that they would eventually be detected, as the cook,
from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him
through the window, was a man of most remarkable appearance&mdash;being a huge
and hideous mulatto, with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type. This
man has been seen since the crime, for he was detected and pursued by Constable
Walters on the same evening, when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria
Lodge. Inspector Baynes, considering that such a visit must have some purpose
in view and was likely, therefore, to be repeated, abandoned the house but left
an ambuscade in the shrubbery. The man walked into the trap and was captured
last night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the
savage. We understand that when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates
a remand will be applied for by the police, and that great developments are
hoped from his capture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really we must see Baynes at once,&rdquo; cried Holmes, picking up his
hat. &ldquo;We will just catch him before he starts.&rdquo; We hurried down the
village street and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was just
leaving his lodgings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the paper, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo; he asked, holding one
out to us.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Baynes, I&rsquo;ve seen it. Pray don&rsquo;t think it a liberty if
I give you a word of friendly warning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of warning, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have looked into this case with some care, and I am not convinced that
you are on the right lines. I don&rsquo;t want you to commit yourself too far
unless you are sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure you I speak for your good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of
Mr. Baynes&rsquo;s tiny eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr. Holmes. That&rsquo;s what I am
doing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very good,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; I believe you mean well by me. But we all have our own systems,
Mr. Holmes. You have yours, and maybe I have mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us say no more about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome always to my news. This fellow is a perfect savage,
as strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil. He chewed Downing&rsquo;s
thumb nearly off before they could master him. He hardly speaks a word of
English, and we can get nothing out of him but grunts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so, Mr. Holmes; I didn&rsquo;t say so. We all have
our little ways. You try yours and I will try mine. That&rsquo;s the
agreement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
make the man out. He seems to be riding for a fall. Well, as he says, we must
each try our own way and see what comes of it. But there&rsquo;s something in
Inspector Baynes which I can&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just sit down in that chair, Watson,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes when we
had returned to our apartment at the Bull. &ldquo;I want to put you in touch
with the situation, as I may need your help to-night. Let me show you the
evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it. Simple as it
has been in its leading features, it has none the less presented surprising
difficulties in the way of an arrest. There are gaps in that direction which we
have still to fill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the
evening of his death. We may put aside this idea of Baynes&rsquo;s that
Garcia&rsquo;s servants were concerned in the matter. The proof of this lies in
the fact that it was <i>he</i> who had arranged for the presence of Scott
Eccles, which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi. It was
Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and apparently a criminal enterprise, in
hand that night in the course of which he met his death. I say
&lsquo;criminal&rsquo; because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to
establish an alibi. Who, then, is most likely to have taken his life? Surely
the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed. So far it seems
to me that we are on safe ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia&rsquo;s
household. They were <i>all</i> confederates in the same unknown crime. If it
came off when Garcia returned, any possible suspicion would be warded off by
the Englishman&rsquo;s evidence, and all would be well. But the attempt was a
dangerous one, and if Garcia did <i>not</i> return by a certain hour it was
probable that his own life had been sacrificed. It had been arranged,
therefore, that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some
prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position
afterwards to renew their attempt. That would fully explain the facts, would it
not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me. I wondered,
as I always did, how it had not been obvious to me before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why should one servant return?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious,
something which he could not bear to part with, had been left behind. That
would explain his persistence, would it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is the next step?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner. It indicates
a confederate at the other end. Now, where was the other end? I have already
shown you that it could only lie in some large house, and that the number of
large houses is limited. My first days in this village were devoted to a series
of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a
reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history
of the occupants. One house, and only one, riveted my attention. It is the
famous old Jacobean grange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side of
Oxshott, and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy. The other
mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from
romance. But Mr. Henderson, of High Gable, was by all accounts a curious man to
whom curious adventures might befall. I concentrated my attention, therefore,
upon him and his household.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A singular set of people, Watson&mdash;the man himself the most singular
of them all. I managed to see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to read
in his dark, deepset, brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of my true
business. He is a man of fifty, strong, active, with iron-grey hair, great
bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer and the air of an emperor&mdash;a
fierce, masterful man, with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face. He is
either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics, for he is yellow and
sapless, but tough as whipcord. His friend and secretary, Mr. Lucas, is
undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate brown, wily, suave, and catlike, with a
poisonous gentleness of speech. You see, Watson, we have come already upon two
sets of foreigners&mdash;one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable&mdash;so
our gaps are beginning to close.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the
household; but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be
even more important. Henderson has two children&mdash;girls of eleven and
thirteen. Their governess is a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman of forty or
thereabouts. There is also one confidential manservant. This little group forms
the real family, for they travel about together, and Henderson is a great
traveller, always on the move. It is only within the last weeks that he has
returned, after a year&rsquo;s absence, to High Gable. I may add that he is
enormously rich, and whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them.
For the rest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maidservants, and the
usual overfed, underworked staff of a large English country house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own
observation. There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a
grievance, and I was lucky enough to find one. I call it luck, but it would not
have come my way had I not been looking out for it. As Baynes remarks, we all
have our systems. It was my system which enabled me to find John Warner, late
gardener of High Gable, sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer.
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and
dislike of their master. So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curious people, Watson! I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand it all yet,
but very curious people anyway. It&rsquo;s a double-winged house, and the
servants live on one side, the family on the other. There&rsquo;s no link
between the two save for Henderson&rsquo;s own servant, who serves the
family&rsquo;s meals. Everything is carried to a certain door, which forms the
one connection. Governess and children hardly go out at all, except into the
garden. Henderson never by any chance walks alone. His dark secretary is like
his shadow. The gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly
afraid of something. &lsquo;Sold his soul to the devil in exchange for
money,&rsquo; says Warner, &lsquo;and expects his creditor to come up and claim
his own.&rsquo; Where they came from, or who they are, nobody has an idea. They
are very violent. Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with his dog-whip, and
only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new information.
We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an
invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned.
Who wrote the note? It was someone within the citadel, and it was a woman. Who
then but Miss Burnet, the governess? All our reasoning seems to point that way.
At any rate, we may take it as a hypothesis and see what consequences it would
entail. I may add that Miss Burnet&rsquo;s age and character make it certain
that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of
the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of
Garcia. What, then, might she be expected to do if she heard of his death? If
he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed. Still, in her
heart, she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him
and would presumably help so far as she could to have revenge upon them. Could
we see her, then and try to use her? That was my first thought. But now we come
to a sinister fact. Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the
night of the murder. From that evening she has utterly vanished. Is she alive?
Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had
summoned? Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point which we still have
to decide.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. There is
nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme might seem
fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The woman&rsquo;s disappearance counts
for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be
invisible for a week. And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her
life. All I can do is to watch the house and leave my agent, Warner, on guard
at the gates. We can&rsquo;t let such a situation continue. If the law can do
nothing we must take the risk ourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you suggest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know which is her room. It is accessible from the top of an outhouse.
My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the
very heart of the mystery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not, I must confess, a very alluring prospect. The old house with its
atmosphere of murder, the singular and formidable inhabitants, the unknown
dangers of the approach, and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in
a false position all combined to damp my ardour. But there was something in the
ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any
adventure which he might recommend. One knew that thus, and only thus, could a
solution be found. I clasped his hand in silence, and the die was cast.
</p>

<p>
But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an
ending. It was about five o&rsquo;clock, and the shadows of the March evening
were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic rushed into our room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone, Mr. Holmes. They went by the last train. The lady
broke away, and I&rsquo;ve got her in a cab downstairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excellent, Warner!&rdquo; cried Holmes, springing to his feet.
&ldquo;Watson, the gaps are closing rapidly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She bore upon
her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent tragedy. Her head
hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes
upon us I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the centre of the broad grey
iris. She was drugged with opium.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I watched at the gate, same as you advised, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said our
emissary, the discharged gardener. &ldquo;When the carriage came out I followed
it to the station. She was like one walking in her sleep, but when they tried
to get her into the train she came to life and struggled. They pushed her into
the carriage. She fought her way out again. I took her part, got her into a
cab, and here we are. I shan&rsquo;t forget the face at the carriage window as
I led her away. I&rsquo;d have a short life if he had his way&mdash;the
black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa, and a couple of cups of the
strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug. Baynes had
been summoned by Holmes, and the situation rapidly explained to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, sir, you&rsquo;ve got me the very evidence I want,&rdquo; said the
inspector warmly, shaking my friend by the hand. &ldquo;I was on the same scent
as you from the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! You were after Henderson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I
was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below. It was just
who would get his evidence first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why did you arrest the mulatto?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Baynes chuckled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt that he was suspected,
and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any
danger. I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off
him. I knew he would be likely to clear off then and give us a chance of
getting at Miss Burnet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will rise high in your profession. You have instinct and
intuition,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
Baynes flushed with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week.
Wherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight. But he must have
been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away. However, your man picked her
up, and it all ends well. We can&rsquo;t arrest without her evidence, that is
clear, so the sooner we get a statement the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every minute she gets stronger,&rdquo; said Holmes, glancing at the
governess. &ldquo;But tell me, Baynes, who is this man Henderson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Henderson,&rdquo; the inspector answered, &ldquo;is Don Murillo, once
called the Tiger of San Pedro.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Tiger of San Pedro! The whole history of the man came back to me in a
flash. He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had
ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization. Strong, fearless,
and energetic, he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious
vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years. His name was a terror
through all Central America. At the end of that time there was a universal
rising against him. But he was as cunning as he was cruel, and at the first
whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship
which was manned by devoted adherents. It was an empty palace which was stormed
by the insurgents next day. The dictator, his two children, his secretary, and
his wealth had all escaped them. From that moment he had vanished from the
world, and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in the European
press.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,&rdquo; said Baynes.
&ldquo;If you look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and
white, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called himself, but I
traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where his ship came in
in &rsquo;86. They&rsquo;ve been looking for him all the time for their
revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They discovered him a year ago,&rdquo; said Miss Burnet, who had sat up
and was now intently following the conversation. &ldquo;Once already his life
has been attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him. Now, again, it is the
noble, chivalrous Garcia who has fallen, while the monster goes safe. But
another will come, and yet another, until some day justice will be done; that
is as certain as the rise of to-morrow&rsquo;s sun.&rdquo; Her thin hands
clenched, and her worn face blanched with the passion of her hatred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how come you into this matter, Miss Burnet?&rdquo; asked Holmes.
&ldquo;How can an English lady join in such a murderous affair?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice
can be gained. What does the law of England care for the rivers of blood shed
years ago in San Pedro, or for the shipload of treasure which this man has
stolen? To you they are like crimes committed in some other planet. But
<i>we</i> know. We have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering. To us
there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo, and no peace in life while his
victims still cry for vengeance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;he was as you say. I have heard
that he was atrocious. But how are you affected?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will tell you it all. This villain&rsquo;s policy was to murder, on
one pretext or another, every man who showed such promise that he might in time
come to be a dangerous rival. My husband&mdash;yes, my real name is Signora
Victor Durando&mdash;was the San Pedro minister in London. He met me and
married me there. A nobler man never lived upon earth. Unhappily, Murillo heard
of his excellence, recalled him on some pretext, and had him shot. With a
premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him. His estates were
confiscated, and I was left with a pittance and a broken heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then came the downfall of the tyrant. He escaped as you have just
described. But the many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest and dearest
had suffered torture and death at his hands, would not let the matter rest.
They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the
work was done. It was my part after we had discovered in the transformed
Henderson the fallen despot, to attach myself to his household and keep the
others in touch with his movements. This I was able to do by securing the
position of governess in his family. He little knew that the woman who faced
him at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hour&rsquo;s
notice into eternity. I smiled on him, did my duty to his children, and bided
my time. An attempt was made in Paris and failed. We zig-zagged swiftly here
and there over Europe to throw off the pursuers and finally returned to this
house, which he had taken upon his first arrival in England.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But here also the ministers of justice were waiting. Knowing that he
would return there, Garcia, who is the son of the former highest dignitary in
San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty companions of humble station, all three
fired with the same reasons for revenge. He could do little during the day, for
Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas,
or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness. At night, however, he
slept alone, and the avenger might find him. On a certain evening, which had
been prearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was forever
on the alert and continually changed his room. I was to see that the doors were
open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive
was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But everything went wrong with us. In some way I had excited the
suspicion of Lopez, the secretary. He crept up behind me and sprang upon me
just as I had finished the note. He and his master dragged me to my room and
held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress. Then and there they would have
plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the
consequences of the deed. Finally, after much debate, they concluded that my
murder was too dangerous. But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia.
They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the
address. I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it
would mean to Garcia. Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed it
with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, José. How they
murdered him I do not know, save that it was Murillo&rsquo;s hand who struck
him down, for Lopez had remained to guard me. I believe he must have waited
among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he
passed. At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him
as a detected burglar; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry
their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open
to further attacks. With the death of Garcia, the pursuit might cease, since
such a death might frighten others from the task.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge
of what they had done. I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung
in the balance. I was confined to my room, terrorised by the most horrible
threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit&mdash;see this stab on my shoulder
and the bruises from end to end of my arms&mdash;and a gag was thrust into my
mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call from the window. For five days
this cruel imprisonment continued, with hardly enough food to hold body and
soul together. This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after
I took it I knew that I had been drugged. In a sort of dream I remember being
half-led, half-carried to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the
train. Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly realise
that my liberty lay in my own hands. I sprang out, they tried to drag me back,
and had it not been for the help of this good man, who led me to the cab, I
should never had broken away. Now, thank God, I am beyond their power
forever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement. It was Holmes who
broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our difficulties are not over,&rdquo; he remarked, shaking his head.
&ldquo;Our police work ends, but our legal work begins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;A plausible lawyer could make it out as
an act of self-defence. There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it
is only on this one that they can be tried.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Baynes cheerily, &ldquo;I think better of the
law than that. Self-defence is one thing. To entice a man in cold blood with
the object of murdering him is another, whatever danger you may fear from him.
No, no, we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the
next Guildford Assizes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is a matter of history, however, that a little time was still to elapse
before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts. Wily and bold, he
and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by entering a
lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the back-gate into Curzon
Square. From that day they were seen no more in England. Some six months
afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and Signor Rulli, his secretary, were both
murdered in their rooms at the Hotel Escurial at Madrid. The crime was ascribed
to Nihilism, and the murderers were never arrested. Inspector Baynes visited us
at Baker Street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary,
and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted brows of
his master. We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had come at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A chaotic case, my dear Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes over an evening pipe.
&ldquo;It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is
dear to your heart. It covers two continents, concerns two groups of mysterious
persons, and is further complicated by the highly respectable presence of our
friend, Scott Eccles, whose inclusion shows me that the deceased Garcia had a
scheming mind and a well-developed instinct of self-preservation. It is
remarkable only for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we,
with our worthy collaborator, the inspector, have kept our close hold on the
essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path. Is there any
point which is not quite clear to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The object of the mulatto cook&rsquo;s return?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it. The
man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and this was his
fetish. When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged
retreat&mdash;already occupied, no doubt by a confederate&mdash;the companion
had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture. But the
mulatto&rsquo;s heart was with it, and he was driven back to it next day, when,
on reconnoitering through the window, he found policeman Walters in possession.
He waited three days longer, and then his piety or his superstition drove him
to try once more. Inspector Baynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had
minimised the incident before me, had really recognised its importance and had
left a trap into which the creature walked. Any other point, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery of
that weird kitchen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other
points. Here is a quotation from Eckermann&rsquo;s <i>Voodooism and the Negroid
Religions:</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;&lsquo;The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without
certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods. In
extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed by
cannibalism. The more usual victims are a white cock, which is plucked in
pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and body burned.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. It is
grotesque, Watson,&rdquo; Holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook,
&ldquo;but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from the
grotesque to the horrible.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap02"></a>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans</h3>

<p>
In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled
down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever
possible from our windows in Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite
houses. The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of
references. The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject
which he had recently made his hobby&mdash;the music of the Middle Ages. But
when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw
the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily
drops upon the window-panes, my comrade&rsquo;s impatient and active nature
could endure this drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our
sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the
furniture, and chafing against inaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal
interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an
impending change of government; but these did not come within the horizon of my
companion. I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not
commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,&rdquo; said he in the
querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. &ldquo;Look out
this window, Watson. See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then
blend once more into the cloud-bank. The thief or the murderer could roam
London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and
then evident only to his victim.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There have,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;been numerous petty thefts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes snorted his contempt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than
that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is fortunate for this community that I am not a
criminal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is, indeed!&rdquo; said I heartily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who
have good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against my own
pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they
don&rsquo;t have days of fog in the Latin countries&mdash;the countries of
assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead
monotony.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well! What next?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Brother Mycroft is coming
round.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not? It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane.
Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them. His Pall Mall lodgings, the Diogenes
Club, Whitehall&mdash;that is his cycle. Once, and only once, he has been here.
What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does he not explain?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes handed me his brother&rsquo;s telegram.
</p>

<table><tr><td> &ldquo;Must see you over Cadogan West. Coming at once.&rdquo;
</td></tr> <tr><td align="right">M<small>YCROFT</small>. </td></tr> </table>

<p>
&ldquo;Cadogan West? I have heard the name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It recalls nothing to my mind. But that Mycroft should break out in this
erratic fashion! A planet might as well leave its orbit. By the way, do you
know what Mycroft is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the Adventure of
the Greek Interpreter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You told me that he had some small office under the British
government.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes chuckled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to be discreet
when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in thinking that he is
under the British government. You would also be right in a sense if you said
that occasionally he <i>is</i> the British government.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Holmes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty
pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will
receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most indispensable man in the
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, his position is unique. He has made it for himself. There has
never been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the tidiest and
most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man
living. The same great powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he
has used for this particular business. The conclusions of every department are
passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes
out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is
omniscience. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point
which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could
get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft
can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other.
They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself
an essential. In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be
handed out in an instant. Again and again his word has decided the national
policy. He lives in it. He thinks of nothing else save when, as an intellectual
exercise, he unbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my
little problems. But Jupiter is descending to-day. What on earth can it mean?
Who is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon
the sofa. &ldquo;Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogan West was the young
man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my brother to
alter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the world can he have to do
with it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The young man had
apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself. He had not been robbed,
and there was no particular reason to suspect violence. Is that not so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There has been an inquest,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and a good many fresh
facts have come out. Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was
a curious case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a most
extraordinary one.&rdquo; He snuggled down in his armchair. &ldquo;Now, Watson,
let us have the facts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-seven years
of age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Government employ. Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen by his fiancée,
Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7:30 that evening.
There was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action.
The next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a
plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate Station on the Underground system
in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The body was found at six on Tuesday morning. It was lying wide of the
metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close
to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. The
head was badly crushed&mdash;an injury which might well have been caused by a
fall from the train. The body could only have come on the line in that way. Had
it been carried down from any neighbouring street, it must have passed the
station barriers, where a collector is always standing. This point seems
absolutely certain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. The case is definite enough. The man, dead or alive, either
fell or was precipitated from a train. So much is clear to me. Continue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was
found are those which run from west to east, some being purely Metropolitan,
and some from Willesden and outlying junctions. It can be stated for certain
that this young man, when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at
some late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is
impossible to state.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His ticket, of course, would show that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There was no ticket in his pockets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According to
my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train
without exhibiting one&rsquo;s ticket. Presumably, then, the young man had one.
Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came? It is
possible. Or did he drop it in the carriage? That is also possible. But the
point is of curious interest. I understand that there was no sign of
robbery?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Apparently not. There is a list here of his possessions. His purse
contained two pounds fifteen. He had also a check-book on the Woolwich branch
of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through this his identity was established.
There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for
that very evening. Also a small packet of technical papers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There we have it at last, Watson! British government&mdash;Woolwich.
Arsenal&mdash;technical papers&mdash;Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.
But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the
room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical
inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head
so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-grey, deep-set eyes, so firm in
its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance
one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.
</p>

<p>
At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard&mdash;thin and
austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest. The
detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his
overcoat and subsided into an armchair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A most annoying business, Sherlock,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I extremely
dislike altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. In the
present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the office.
But it is a real crisis. I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset. As to
the Admiralty&mdash;it is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive. Have you read up
the case?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have just done so. What were the technical papers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The press
would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had in his
pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance
of the subject. His brother and I sat expectant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely you have heard of it? I thought everyone had heard of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only as a name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It has been the most jealously
guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me that naval warfare
becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington&rsquo;s operation.
Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was
expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. Every effort has been made
to keep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some
thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept
in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with
burglar-proof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances were the
plans to be taken from the office. If the chief constructor of the Navy desired
to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the
purpose. And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the
heart of London. From an official point of view it&rsquo;s simply awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you have recovered them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Sherlock, no! That&rsquo;s the pinch. We have not. Ten papers were
taken from Woolwich. There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The three
most essential are gone&mdash;stolen, vanished. You must drop everything,
Sherlock. Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It&rsquo;s a
vital international problem that you have to solve. Why did Cadogan West take
the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where
it was found, how can the evil be set right? Find an answer to all these
questions, and you will have done good service for your country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? You can see as far as
I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of getting details. Give me
your details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent expert
opinion. But to run here and run there, to cross-question railway guards, and
lie on my face with a lens to my eye&mdash;it is not my metier. No, you are the
one man who can clear the matter up. If you have a fancy to see your name in
the next honours list&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My friend smiled and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I play the game for the game&rsquo;s own sake,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;But the problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall
be very pleased to look into it. Some more facts, please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper,
together with a few addresses which you will find of service. The actual
official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert, Sir James
Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference.
He has grown grey in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most
exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion. He
is one of two who have a key of the safe. I may add that the papers were
undoubtedly in the office during working hours on Monday, and that Sir James
left for London about three o&rsquo;clock taking his key with him. He was at
the house of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening
when this incident occurred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has the fact been verified?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his
departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir
James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who was the other man with a key?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson. He is a man of
forty, married, with five children. He is a silent, morose man, but he has, on
the whole, an excellent record in the public service. He is unpopular with his
colleagues, but a hard worker. According to his own account, corroborated only
by the word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening after
office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain upon which it
hangs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell us about Cadogan West.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has been ten years in the service and has done good work. He has the
reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight, honest man. We
have nothing against him. He was next Sidney Johnson in the office. His duties
brought him into daily, personal contact with the plans. No one else had the
handling of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who locked up the plans that night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away. They are actually
found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That seems final,
does it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained. In the first
place, why did he take them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I presume they were of value?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He could have got several thousands for them very easily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London
except to sell them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I cannot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. Young West took the
papers. Now this could only be done by having a false key&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Several false keys. He had to open the building and the room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had, then, several false keys. He took the papers to London to sell
the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the safe
next morning before they were missed. While in London on this treasonable
mission he met his end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was
killed and thrown out of the compartment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station
London Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London
Bridge. There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he was having
an absorbing interview. This interview led to a violent scene in which he lost
his life. Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so
met his end. The other closed the door. There was a thick fog, and nothing
could be seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet
consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched. We will suppose, for
argument&rsquo;s sake, that young Cadogan West <i>had</i> determined to convey
these papers to London. He would naturally have made an appointment with the
foreign agent and kept his evening clear. Instead of that he took two tickets
for the theatre, escorted his fiancée halfway there, and then suddenly
disappeared.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A blind,&rdquo; said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some
impatience to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No. 2: We will
suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent. He must bring back
the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered. He took away ten.
Only seven were in his pocket. What had become of the other three? He certainly
would not leave them of his own free will. Then, again, where is the price of
his treason? One would have expected to find a large sum of money in his
pocket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems to me perfectly clear,&rdquo; said Lestrade. &ldquo;I have no
doubt at all as to what occurred. He took the papers to sell them. He saw the
agent. They could not agree as to price. He started home again, but the agent
went with him. In the train the agent murdered him, took the more essential
papers, and threw his body from the carriage. That would account for
everything, would it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why had he no ticket?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent&rsquo;s
house. Therefore he took it from the murdered man&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good, Lestrade, very good,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Your theory holds
together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end. On the one hand, the
traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine are
presumably already on the Continent. What is there for us to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To act, Sherlock&mdash;to act!&rdquo; cried Mycroft, springing to his
feet. &ldquo;All my instincts are against this explanation. Use your powers! Go
to the scene of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no stone unturned!
In all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;Come,
Watson! And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or
two? We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station. Good-bye,
Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in
advance that you have little to expect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground railroad at the
point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before Aldgate Station. A
courteous red-faced old gentleman represented the railway company.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is where the young man&rsquo;s body lay,&rdquo; said he, indicating
a spot about three feet from the metals. &ldquo;It could not have fallen from
above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could only
have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must have
passed about midnight on Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No record of a door being found open?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have had some fresh evidence this morning,&rdquo; said Lestrade.
&ldquo;A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about
11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body
striking the line, just before the train reached the station. There was dense
fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made no report of it at the time.
Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face,
staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel. Aldgate is a
junction, and there was a network of points. On these his eager, questioning
eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips,
that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which
I knew so well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Points,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;the points.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What of it? What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as
this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; they are very few.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove! if it were only
so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An idea&mdash;an indication, no more. But the case certainly grows in
interest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? I do not see any
indications of bleeding on the line.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There were hardly any.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I understand that there was a considerable wound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it be possible for
me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a
fall in the fog?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and the
carriages redistributed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said Lestrade, &ldquo;that every
carriage has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was one of my friend&rsquo;s most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient
with less alert intelligences than his own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said he, turning away. &ldquo;As it happens, it was
not the carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can
here. We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade. I think our
investigations must now carry us to Woolwich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he handed to me
before dispatching it. It ran thus:
</p>

<p class="letter">
See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out. Meanwhile,
please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a complete list of
all foreign spies or international agents known to be in England, with full
address.&mdash;Sherlock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That should be helpful, Watson,&rdquo; he remarked as we took our seats
in the Woolwich train. &ldquo;We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for
having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable
case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung energy,
which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a
stimulating line of thought. See the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping
tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with
gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high
scent&mdash;such was the change in Holmes since the morning. He was a different
man from the limp and lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who
had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is material here. There is scope,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am dull
indeed not to have understood its possibilities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even now they are dark to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead
us far. The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the <i>roof</i> of
a carriage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the roof!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remarkable, is it not? But consider the facts. Is it a coincidence that
it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes
round on the points? Is not that the place where an object upon the roof might
be expected to fall off? The points would affect no object inside the train.
Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred.
But now consider the question of the blood. Of course, there was no bleeding on
the line if the body had bled elsewhere. Each fact is suggestive in itself.
Together they have a cumulative force.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the ticket, too!&rdquo; I cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. We could not explain the absence of a ticket. This would
explain it. Everything fits together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling the
mystery of his death. Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Holmes, thoughtfully, &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo; He
relapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at
last in Woolwich Station. There he called a cab and drew Mycroft&rsquo;s paper
from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns stretching
down to the Thames. As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin, watery
sunshine was breaking through. A butler answered our ring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir James, sir!&rdquo; said he with solemn face. &ldquo;Sir James died
this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Holmes in amazement. &ldquo;How did he
die?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel
Valentine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we had best do so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we were
joined by a very tall, handsome, light-bearded man of fifty, the younger
brother of the dead scientist. His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair
all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. He was hardly
articulate as he spoke of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was this horrible scandal,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My brother, Sir
James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an
affair. It broke his heart. He was always so proud of the efficiency of his
department, and this was a crushing blow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would
have helped us to clear the matter up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all
of us. He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police.
Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty. But all the rest was
inconceivable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. I have no desire
to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are much
disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an
end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is indeed an unexpected development,&rdquo; said my friend when we
had regained the cab. &ldquo;I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the
poor old fellow killed himself! If the latter, may it be taken as some sign of
self-reproach for duty neglected? We must leave that question to the future.
Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved
mother. The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us, but at
her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet
Westbury, the fiancée of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal
night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have not shut
an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what the
true meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-minded, chivalrous,
patriotic man upon earth. He would have cut his right hand off before he would
sell a State secret confided to his keeping. It is absurd, impossible,
preposterous to anyone who knew him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the facts, Miss Westbury?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was he in any want of money?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample. He had saved a few
hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No signs of any mental excitement? Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely
frank with us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner. She coloured
and hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I had a feeling that there was
something on his mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only for the last week or so. He was thoughtful and worried. Once I
pressed him about it. He admitted that there was something, and that it was
concerned with his official life. &lsquo;It is too serious for me to speak
about, even to you,&rsquo; said he. I could get nothing more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes looked grave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. We
cannot say what it may lead to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or twice it seemed to me that
he was on the point of telling me something. He spoke one evening of the
importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he said that no
doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My friend&rsquo;s face grew graver still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said that we were slack about such matters&mdash;that it would be
easy for a traitor to get the plans.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it only recently that he made such remarks?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, quite recently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now tell us of that last evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We were to go to the theatre. The fog was so thick that a cab was
useless. We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly he darted
away into the fog.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Without a word?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited but he never returned.
Then I walked home. Next morning, after the office opened, they came to
inquire. About twelve o&rsquo;clock we heard the terrible news. Oh, Mr. Holmes,
if you could only, only save his honour! It was so much to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Watson,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our ways lie elsewhere. Our next
station must be the office from which the papers were taken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries
make it blacker,&rdquo; he remarked as the cab lumbered off. &ldquo;His coming
marriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally wanted money. The idea was
in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accomplice in
the treason by telling her his plans. It is all very bad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? Then, again, why
should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it is a formidable case
which they have to meet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received us with
that respect which my companion&rsquo;s card always commanded. He was a thin,
gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard, and his hands
twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been subjected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you heard of the death of the
chief?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have just come from his house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The place is disorganised. The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our papers
stolen. And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we were as
efficient an office as any in the government service. Good God, it&rsquo;s
dreadful to think of! That West, of all men, should have done such a
thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are sure of his guilt, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can see no other way out of it. And yet I would have trusted him as I
trust myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At what hour was the office closed on Monday?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At five.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you close it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am always the last man out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where were the plans?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In that safe. I put them there myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there no watchman to the building?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an
old soldier and a most trustworthy man. He saw nothing that evening. Of course
the fog was very thick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building after
hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could reach the
papers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he would. The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and the
key of the safe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had no keys of the doors&mdash;only of the safe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think he was. I know that so far as those three keys are
concerned he kept them on the same ring. I have often seen them there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that ring went with him to London?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your key never left your possession?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate. And yet none
was found upon his body. One other point: if a clerk in this office desired to
sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to
take the originals, as was actually done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an
effective way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical
knowledge?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No doubt we had, but I beg you won&rsquo;t try to drag me into the
matter, Mr. Holmes. What is the use of our speculating in this way when the
original plans were actually found on West?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking
originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have equally served
his turn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Singular, no doubt&mdash;and yet he did so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable. Now there are
three papers still missing. They are, as I understand, the vital ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without
the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But to-day I have been over
the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it. The double valves with the
automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been
returned. Until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not
make the boat. Of course they might soon get over the difficulty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the three missing drawings are the most important?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the
premises. I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the iron
shutters of the window. It was only when we were on the lawn outside that his
interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush outside the window, and
several of the branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped. He
examined them carefully with his lens, and then some dim and vague marks upon
the earth beneath. Finally he asked the chief clerk to close the iron shutters,
and he pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it would
be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The indications are ruined by three days&rsquo; delay. They may mean
something or nothing. Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can help us
further. It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see if we can do
better in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich Station. The
clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence that he saw Cadogan
West&mdash;whom he knew well by sight&mdash;upon the Monday night, and that he
went to London by the 8:15 to London Bridge. He was alone and took a single
third-class ticket. The clerk was struck at the time by his excited and nervous
manner. So shaky was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk
had helped him with it. A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was
the first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the
lady about 7:30.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us reconstruct, Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes after half an hour of
silence. &ldquo;I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever
had a case which was more difficult to get at. Every fresh advance which we
make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely made some
appreciable progress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against
young Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend themselves to
a more favourable hypothesis. Let us suppose, for example, that he had been
approached by some foreign agent. It might have been done under such pledges as
would have prevented him from speaking of it, and yet would have affected his
thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancée. Very good.
We will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he
suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the
direction of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his decisions.
Everything gave way to his duty. He followed the man, reached the window, saw
the abstraction of the documents, and pursued the thief. In this way we get
over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies.
This outsider had to take originals. So far it holds together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the next step?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we come into difficulties. One would imagine that under such
circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the villain
and raise the alarm. Why did he not do so? Could it have been an official
superior who took the papers? That would explain West&rsquo;s conduct. Or could
the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and West started at once to
London to head him off from his own rooms, presuming that he knew where the
rooms were? The call must have been very pressing, since he left his girl
standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her. Our scent runs
cold here, and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of
West&rsquo;s body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a
Metropolitan train. My instinct now is to work from the other end. If Mycroft
has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow
two tracks instead of one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street. A government messenger had
brought it post-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw it over to me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an affair. The
only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13, Great George Street,
Westminster; Louis La Rothière, of Campden Mansions, Notting Hill; and Hugo
Oberstein, 13, Caulfield Gardens, Kensington. The latter was known to be in town
on Monday and is now reported as having left. Glad to hear you have seen some
light. The Cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety. Urgent
representations have arrived from the very highest quarter. The whole force of
the State is at your back if you should need it.&mdash;Mycroft.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Holmes, smiling, &ldquo;that all the
Queen&rsquo;s horses and all the Queen&rsquo;s men cannot avail in this
matter.&rdquo; He had spread out his big map of London and leaned eagerly over
it. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he presently with an exclamation of
satisfaction, &ldquo;things are turning a little in our direction at last. Why,
Watson, I do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off, after
all.&rdquo; He slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity.
&ldquo;I am going out now. It is only a reconnaissance. I will do nothing
serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow. Do you stay
here, and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two. If time
hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved
the State.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well that he
would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour unless there was
good cause for exultation. All the long November evening I waited, filled with
impatience for his return. At last, shortly after nine o&rsquo;clock, there
arrived a messenger with a note:
</p>

<p class="letter">
Am dining at Goldini&rsquo;s Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please
come at once and join me there. Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a
chisel, and a revolver.&mdash;S.H.
</p>

<p>
It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim,
fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat and drove
straight to the address given. There sat my friend at a little round table near
the door of the garish Italian restaurant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee and curaçao. Try
one of the proprietor&rsquo;s cigars. They are less poisonous than one would
expect. Have you the tools?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are here, in my overcoat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with some
indication of what we are about to do. Now it must be evident to you, Watson,
that this young man&rsquo;s body was <i>placed</i> on the roof of the train.
That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that it was from the
roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should say it was impossible. If you examine the roofs you will find
that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round them. Therefore,
we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was placed on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could he be placed there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the question which we had to answer. There is only one possible
way. You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in
the West End. I had a vague memory that as I have travelled by it I have
occasionally seen windows just above my head. Now, suppose that a train halted
under such a window, would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the
roof?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems most improbable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies
fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Here all other
contingencies <i>have</i> failed. When I found that the leading international
agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses which abutted upon
the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my
sudden frivolity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that was it, was it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13, Caulfield Gardens, had
become my objective. I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station, where a
very helpful official walked with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy
myself not only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gardens open on the
line but the even more essential fact that, owing to the intersection of one of
the larger railways, the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for
some minutes at that very spot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So far&mdash;so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar. Well,
having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied
myself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable house, unfurnished,
so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a
single valet, who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence. We
must bear in mind that Oberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his
booty, but not with any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant,
and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to
him. Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could we not get a warrant and legalise it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hardly on the evidence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can we hope to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. I&rsquo;ll do the
criminal part. It&rsquo;s not a time to stick at trifles. Think of
Mycroft&rsquo;s note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who
waits for news. We are bound to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My answer was to rise from the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are right, Holmes. We are bound to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sprang up and shook me by the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew you would not shrink at the last,&rdquo; said he, and for a
moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had
ever seen. The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry. Let us walk,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drop the instruments, I beg. Your arrest as a
suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and porticoed
houses which are so prominent a product of the middle Victorian epoch in the
West End of London. Next door there appeared to be a children&rsquo;s party,
for the merry buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through
the night. The fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly shade.
Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a serious proposition,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is certainly
bolted as well as locked. We would do better in the area. There is an excellent
archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude. Give me a
hand, Watson, and I&rsquo;ll do the same for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we reached the dark shadows
before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above. As its soft rhythm
died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower door. I saw him stoop and strain
until with a sharp crash it flew open. We sprang through into the dark passage,
closing the area door behind us. Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted
stair. His little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here we are, Watson&mdash;this must be the one.&rdquo; He threw it open,
and as he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud
roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light along
the window-sill. It was thickly coated with soot from the passing engines, but
the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can see where they rested the body. Halloa, Watson! what is this?
There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.&rdquo; He was pointing to faint
discolorations along the woodwork of the window. &ldquo;Here it is on the
stone of the stair also. The demonstration is complete. Let us stay here until
a train stops.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We had not long to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel as before,
but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes, pulled up
immediately beneath us. It was not four feet from the window-ledge to the roof
of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So far we are justified,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What do you think of it,
Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A masterpiece. You have never risen to a greater height.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot agree with you there. From the moment that I conceived the idea
of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very abstruse one, all
the rest was inevitable. If it were not for the grave interests involved the
affair up to this point would be insignificant. Our difficulties are still
before us. But perhaps we may find something here which may help us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first
floor. One was a dining-room, severely furnished and containing nothing of
interest. A second was a bedroom, which also drew blank. The remaining room
appeared more promising, and my companion settled down to a systematic
examination. It was littered with books and papers, and was evidently used as a
study. Swiftly and methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after
drawer and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten
his austere face. At the end of an hour he was no further than when he started.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The cunning dog has covered his tracks,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He has
left nothing to incriminate him. His dangerous correspondence has been
destroyed or removed. This is our last chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes pried it
open with his chisel. Several rolls of paper were within, covered with figures
and calculations, without any note to show to what they referred. The recurring
words, &ldquo;water pressure&rdquo; and &ldquo;pressure to the square
inch&rdquo; suggested some possible relation to a submarine. Holmes tossed them
all impatiently aside. There only remained an envelope with some small
newspaper slips inside it. He shook them out on the table, and at once I saw by
his eager face that his hopes had been raised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Watson? Eh? What&rsquo;s this? Record of a series of
messages in the advertisements of a paper. <i>Daily Telegraph</i> agony column
by the print and paper. Right-hand top corner of a page. No dates&mdash;but
messages arrange themselves. This must be the first:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Hoped to hear sooner. Terms agreed to. Write fully to address given on
card.&mdash;Pierrot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next comes:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Too complex for description. Must have full report. Stuff awaits you
when goods delivered.&mdash;Pierrot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then comes:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Matter presses. Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make
appointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.&mdash;Pierrot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Finally:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not be so
suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.&mdash;Pierrot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could only get at the man at the
other end!&rdquo; He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the table.
Finally he sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps it won&rsquo;t be so difficult, after all. There is
nothing more to be done here, Watson. I think we might drive round to the
offices of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and so bring a good day&rsquo;s work to
a conclusion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next
day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day
before. The professional shook his head over our confessed burglary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;No wonder you get results that are beyond us. But some of these days
you&rsquo;ll go too far, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself and your friend in
trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For England, home and beauty&mdash;eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of
our country. But what do you think of it, Mycroft?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use will you make of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes picked up the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> which lay upon the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you seen Pierrot&rsquo;s advertisement to-day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What? Another one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, here it is:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important. Your
own safety at stake.&mdash;Pierrot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; cried Lestrade. &ldquo;If he answers that we&rsquo;ve
got him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was my idea when I put it in. I think if you could both make it
convenient to come with us about eight o&rsquo;clock to Caulfield Gardens we
might possibly get a little nearer to a solution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his power of
throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter
things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to
advantage. I remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost
himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of
Lassus. For my own part I had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in
consequence, appeared to be interminable. The great national importance of the
issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which
we were trying&mdash;all combined to work upon my nerve. It was a relief to me
when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. Lestrade
and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester Road Station.
The area door of Oberstein&rsquo;s house had been left open the night before,
and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly
declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine
o&rsquo;clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our man.
</p>

<p>
An hour passed and yet another. When eleven struck, the measured beat of the
great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. Lestrade and Mycroft
were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a minute at their watches.
Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but every sense on the
alert. He raised his head with a sudden jerk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is coming,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
There had been a furtive step past the door. Now it returned. We heard a
shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. Holmes rose,
motioning us to remain seated. The gas in the hall was a mere point of light.
He opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed
and fastened it. &ldquo;This way!&rdquo; we heard him say, and a moment later
our man stood before us. Holmes had followed him closely, and as the man turned
with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back
into the room. Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut
and Holmes standing with his back against it. The man glared round him,
staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. With the shock, his broad-brimmed
hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his lips, and there were
the long light beard and the soft, handsome delicate features of Colonel
Valentine Walter.
</p>

<p>
Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;This was not the bird that I was looking for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Mycroft eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the
Submarine Department. Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming to. I
think that you had best leave his examination to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. Now our prisoner sat up, looked
round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over his forehead,
like one who cannot believe his own senses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I came here to visit Mr.
Oberstein.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything is known, Colonel Walter,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;How an
English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension. But
your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within our
knowledge. So also are the circumstances connected with the death of young
Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for
repentance and confession, since there are still some details which we can only
learn from your lips.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man groaned and sank his face in his hands. We waited, but he was silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;that every essential is
already known. We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an
impress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into a
correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the
advertisement columns of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. We are aware that you went down
to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed
by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you. He
saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you
were taking the papers to your brother in London. Leaving all his private
concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog
and kept at your heels until you reached this very house. There he intervened,
and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible
crime of murder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I did not!&rdquo; cried
our wretched prisoner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon the
roof of a railway carriage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will. I swear to you that I will. I did the rest. I confess it. It was
just as you say. A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid. I needed the money
badly. Oberstein offered me five thousand. It was to save myself from ruin. But
as to murder, I am as innocent as you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What happened, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe. I
never knew it until I was at the very door. It was thick fog, and one could not
see three yards. I had given two taps and Oberstein had come to the door. The
young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the
papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver. He always carried it with him. As
West forced his way after us into the house Oberstein struck him on the head.
The blow was a fatal one. He was dead within five minutes. There he lay in the
hall, and we were at our wits&rsquo; end what to do. Then Oberstein had this
idea about the trains which halted under his back window. But first he examined
the papers which I had brought. He said that three of them were essential, and
that he must keep them. &lsquo;You cannot keep them,&rsquo; said I.
&lsquo;There will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not
returned.&rsquo; &lsquo;I must keep them,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for they are
so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then they must all go back together to-night,&rsquo; said I. He thought
for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. &lsquo;Three I will
keep,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;The others we will stuff into the pocket of this
young man. When he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his
account.&rsquo; I could see no other way out of it, so we did as he suggested.
We waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped. It was so thick
that nothing could be seen, and we had no difficulty in lowering West&rsquo;s
body on to the train. That was the end of the matter so far as I was
concerned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your brother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think
that he suspected. I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know, he never
held up his head again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was silence in the room. It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you not make reparation? It would ease your conscience, and possibly
your punishment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What reparation can I make?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is Oberstein with the papers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he give you no address?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said that letters to the Hôtel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually
reach him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then reparation is still within your power,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will do anything I can. I owe this fellow no particular good-will. He
has been my ruin and my downfall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here are paper and pen. Sit at this desk and write to my dictation.
Direct the envelope to the address given. That is right. Now the letter:
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Dear Sir:<br/>
&ldquo;With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now
that one essential detail is missing. I have a tracing which will make it
complete. This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I must ask you
for a further advance of five hundred pounds. I will not trust it to the post,
nor will I take anything but gold or notes. I would come to you abroad, but it
would excite remark if I left the country at present. Therefore I shall expect
to meet you in the smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday.
Remember that only English notes, or gold, will be taken.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;That will do very well. I shall be very much surprised if it does not
fetch our man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
And it did! It is a matter of history&mdash;that secret history of a nation
which is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public
chronicles&mdash;that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime,
came to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British prison.
In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans, which he had put
up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his
sentence. As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the
Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for private
circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon the subject. Some
weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at Windsor,
whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin. When I asked him if
he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious
lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small
commission. He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that
lady&rsquo;s august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will
forever recall to my friend&rsquo;s memory the adventure of the
Bruce-Partington plans.

<h3><a name="chap03"></a>The Adventure of the Devil&rsquo;s Foot</h3>

<p>
In recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and interesting
recollections which I associate with my long and intimate friendship with Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by difficulties caused by his
own aversion to publicity. To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular
applause was always abhorrent, and nothing amused him more at the end of a
successful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox
official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced
congratulation. It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and
certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late
years to lay very few of my records before the public. My participation in some
of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and
reticence upon me.
</p>

<p>
It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram from Holmes
last Tuesday&mdash;he has never been known to write where a telegram would
serve&mdash;in the following terms: &ldquo;Why not tell them of the Cornish
horror&mdash;strangest case I have handled.&rdquo; I have no idea what backward
sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had
caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another
cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact
details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.
</p>

<p>
It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes&rsquo;s iron
constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant hard
work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional indiscretions
of his own. In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of Harley Street, whose
dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day recount, gave positive
injunctions that the famous private agent lay aside all his cases and surrender
himself to complete rest if he wished to avert an absolute breakdown. The state
of his health was not a matter in which he himself took the faintest interest,
for his mental detachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the
threat of being permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete
change of scene and air. Thus it was that in the early spring of that year we
found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at the further
extremity of the Cornish peninsula.
</p>

<p>
It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim humour of my
patient. From the windows of our little whitewashed house, which stood high
upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the whole sinister semi-circle of
Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing vessels, with its fringe of black
cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which innumerable seamen have met their end.
With a northerly breeze it lies placid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed
craft to tack into it for rest and protection.
</p>

<p>
Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from the
south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle in the
creaming breakers. The wise mariner stands far out from that evil place.
</p>

<p>
On the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was a
country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-coloured, with an occasional church
tower to mark the site of some old-world village. In every direction upon these
moors there were traces of some vanished race which had passed utterly away,
and left as its sole record strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds which
contained the burned ashes of the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at
prehistoric strife. The glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister
atmosphere of forgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and
he spent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor.
The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and he had, I
remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the Chaldean, and had been
largely derived from the Phœnician traders in tin. He had received a
consignment of books upon philology and was settling down to develop this
thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight, we found
ourselves, even in that land of dreams, plunged into a problem at our very
doors which was more intense, more engrossing, and infinitely more mysterious
than any of those which had driven us from London. Our simple life and
peaceful, healthy routine were violently interrupted, and we were precipitated
into the midst of a series of events which caused the utmost excitement not
only in Cornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers
may retain some recollection of what was called at the time &ldquo;The Cornish
Horror,&rdquo; though a most imperfect account of the matter reached the London
press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true details of this
inconceivable affair to the public.
</p>

<p>
I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this part of
Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the
cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient,
moss-grown church. The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay, was something of an
archæologist, and as such Holmes had made his acquaintance. He was a
middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a considerable fund of local lore. At
his invitation we had taken tea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr.
Mortimer Tregennis, an independent gentleman, who increased the
clergyman&rsquo;s scanty resources by taking rooms in his large, straggling
house. The vicar, being a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement,
though he had little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark,
spectacled man, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical
deformity. I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous,
but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with
averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs.
</p>

<p>
These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little sitting-room on
Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast hour, as we were smoking
together, preparatory to our daily excursion upon the moors.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said the vicar in an agitated voice, &ldquo;the most
extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is the most
unheard-of business. We can only regard it as a special Providence that you
should chance to be here at the time, for in all England you are the one man we
need.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes took his
pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who hears the
view-halloa. He waved his hand to the sofa, and our palpitating visitor with
his agitated companion sat side by side upon it. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was
more self-contained than the clergyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and
the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they shared a common emotion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I speak or you?&rdquo; he asked of the vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and
the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the
speaking,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed lodger
seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes&rsquo;s simple
deduction had brought to their faces.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I had best say a few words first,&rdquo; said the vicar,
&ldquo;and then you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr.
Tregennis, or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this
mysterious affair. I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening
in the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister Brenda,
at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old stone cross upon the
moor. He left them shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock, playing cards round the
dining-room table, in excellent health and spirits. This morning, being an
early riser, he walked in that direction before breakfast and was overtaken by
the carriage of Dr. Richards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a
most urgent call to Tredannick Wartha. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went
with him. When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary state
of things. His two brothers and his sister were seated round the table exactly
as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of them and the candles
burned down to their sockets. The sister lay back stone-dead in her chair,
while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing, shouting, and singing,
the senses stricken clean out of them. All three of them, the dead woman and
the two demented men, retained upon their faces an expression of the utmost
horror&mdash;a convulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon. There was
no sign of the presence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old
cook and housekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound
during the night. Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is
absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a
woman to death and two strong men out of their senses. There is the situation,
Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help us to clear it up you will have
done a great work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the quiet
which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his intense face
and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the expectation. He sat for
some little time in silence, absorbed in the strange drama which had broken in
upon our peace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will look into this matter,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;On the face
of it, it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you been
there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Mr. Holmes. Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the vicarage,
and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About a mile inland.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we shall walk over together. But before we start I must ask you a
few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his more
controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the
clergyman. He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes,
and his thin hands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips quivered as he
listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family, and his dark
eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he eagerly. &ldquo;It is a
bad thing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder
brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards. We sat down about nine
o&rsquo;clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go. I left them all
round the table, as merry as could be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who let you out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out. I shut the hall door
behind me. The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind
was not drawn down. There was no change in door or window this morning, or any
reason to think that any stranger had been to the house. Yet there they sat,
driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head
hanging over the arm of the chair. I&rsquo;ll never get the sight of that room
out of my mind so long as I live.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,&rdquo; said
Holmes. &ldquo;I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way
account for them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!&rdquo; cried Mortimer
Tregennis. &ldquo;It is not of this world. Something has come into that room
which has dashed the light of reason from their minds. What human contrivance
could do that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;that if the matter is beyond humanity
it is certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before
we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr. Tregennis, I take
it you were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and
you had rooms apart?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We were
a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a company, and so
retired with enough to keep us. I won&rsquo;t deny that there was some feeling
about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time, but it was
all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything
stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy? Think
carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing at all, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your people were in their usual spirits?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were they nervous people? Did they ever show any apprehension of coming
danger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is one thing that occurs to me,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;As
we sat at the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being
my partner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once look hard over my shoulder,
so I turned round and looked also. The blind was up and the window shut, but I
could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment
that I saw something moving among them. I couldn&rsquo;t even say if it was man
or animal, but I just thought there was something there. When I asked him what
he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling. That is all that I
can say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you not investigate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; the matter passed as unimportant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this
morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This
morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me. He
told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message. I
sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we looked into that
dreadful room. The candles and the fire must have burned out hours before, and
they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken. The doctor said
Brenda must have been dead at least six hours. There were no signs of violence.
She just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face. George and
Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes. Oh, it
was awful to see! I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, and the doctor was as white as a
sheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly had him
on our hands as well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remarkable&mdash;most remarkable!&rdquo; said Holmes, rising and taking
his hat. &ldquo;I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha
without further delay. I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first
sight presented a more singular problem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation.
It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most
sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy
occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. While we made our way along
it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let
it pass. As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a
horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and
gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My brothers!&rdquo; cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips.
&ldquo;They are taking them to Helston.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way. Then we
turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they had met their
strange fate.
</p>

<p>
It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with a
considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with
spring flowers. Towards this garden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and
from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil
which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds. Holmes
walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before
we entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he
stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet
and the garden path. Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish
housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked after the
wants of the family. She readily answered all Holmes&rsquo;s questions. She had
heard nothing in the night. Her employers had all been in excellent spirits
lately, and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous. She had
fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that
dreadful company round the table. She had, when she recovered, thrown open the
window to let the morning air in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent
a farm-lad for the doctor. The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see
her. It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. She
would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that very
afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.
</p>

<p>
We ascended the stairs and viewed the body. Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a
very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age. Her dark, clear-cut
face was handsome, even in death, but there still lingered upon it something of
that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion. From her
bedroom we descended to the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had
actually occurred. The charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. On
the table were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards
scattered over its surface. The chairs had been moved back against the walls,
but all else was as it had been the night before. Holmes paced with light,
swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them up and
reconstructing their positions. He tested how much of the garden was visible;
he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see
that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have
told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why a fire?&rdquo; he asked once. &ldquo;Had they always a fire in this
small room on a spring evening?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that reason,
after his arrival, the fire was lit. &ldquo;What are you going to do now, Mr.
Holmes?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. &ldquo;I think, Watson, that I
shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often and so
justly condemned,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;With your permission, gentlemen, we
will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is
likely to come to our notice here. I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr.
Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly communicate with
you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish you both good-morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke
his complete and absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his armchair, his haggard
and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his
black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away.
Finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Watson!&rdquo; said he with a laugh. &ldquo;Let us
walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows. We are more likely
to find them than clues to this problem. To let the brain work without
sufficient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to pieces. The
sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson&mdash;all else will come.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,&rdquo; he continued as
we skirted the cliffs together. &ldquo;Let us get a firm grip of the very
little which we <i>do</i> know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready
to fit them into their places. I take it, in the first place, that neither of
us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men. Let us
begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. Very good. There remain three
persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious
human agency. That is firm ground. Now, when did this occur? Evidently,
assuming his narrative to be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer
Tregennis had left the room. That is a very important point. The presumption is
that it was within a few minutes afterwards. The cards still lay upon the
table. It was already past their usual hour for bed. Yet they had not changed
their position or pushed back their chairs. I repeat, then, that the occurrence
was immediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o&rsquo;clock
last night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of
Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room. In this there is no difficulty, and
they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as you do, you were, of
course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I
obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible.
The wet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was also wet, you will
remember, and it was not difficult&mdash;having obtained a sample
print&mdash;to pick out his track among others and to follow his movements. He
appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some
outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that person,
and how was such an impression of horror conveyed? Mrs. Porter may be
eliminated. She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence that someone crept
up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that
he drove those who saw it out of their senses? The only suggestion in this
direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother
spoke about some movement in the garden. That is certainly remarkable, as the
night was rainy, cloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to alarm these
people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he
could be seen. There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but no
indication of a footmark. It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider
could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found
any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt. You perceive our
difficulties, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are only too clear,&rdquo; I answered with conviction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not
insurmountable,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I fancy that among your extensive
archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. Meanwhile, we
shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available, and devote the
rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I may have commented upon my friend&rsquo;s power of mental detachment, but
never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in Cornwall when
for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as
if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution. It was not until we had
returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us,
who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand. Neither of us needed to
be told who that visitor was. The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face
with the fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed
our cottage ceiling, the beard&mdash;golden at the fringes and white near the
lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar&mdash;all these were
as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be associated with the
tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and
explorer.
</p>

<p>
We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice caught sight
of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no advances to us, however,
nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was
his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the
intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of
Beauchamp Arriance. Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely
lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed
to the affairs of his neighbours. It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear
him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance in his
reconstruction of this mysterious episode. &ldquo;The county police are utterly
at fault,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but perhaps your wider experience has
suggested some conceivable explanation. My only claim to being taken into your
confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this
family of Tregennis very well&mdash;indeed, upon my Cornish mother&rsquo;s side
I could call them cousins&mdash;and their strange fate has naturally been a
great shock to me. I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way
to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again
to help in the inquiry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you lose your boat through it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will take the next.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me! that is friendship indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you they were relatives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;cousins of your mother. Was your baggage aboard the
ship?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see. But surely this event could not have found its way into the
Plymouth morning papers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; I had a telegram.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Might I ask from whom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is my business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no objection to telling you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was Mr.
Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I may say in answer to your
original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of
this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion. It would be
premature to say more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any
particular direction?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I can hardly answer that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.&rdquo; The
famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within
five minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw him no more until the evening, when
he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made
no great progress with his investigation. He glanced at a telegram which
awaited him and threw it into the grate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I learned the
name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon
Sterndale&rsquo;s account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last
night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to
Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation. What do you make
of that, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is deeply interested.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Deeply interested&mdash;yes. There is a thread here which we had not yet
grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson, for I am
very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. When it does we may
soon leave our difficulties behind us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realised, or how
strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely
fresh line of investigation. I was shaving at my window in the morning when I
heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop
down the road. It pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from
it and rushed up our garden path. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened
down to meet him.
</p>

<p>
Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last in
gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes! My poor parish is devil-ridden!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Satan himself is loose in it! We are given over into his
hands!&rdquo; He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were
not for his ashy face and startled eyes. Finally he shot out his terrible news.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the same
symptoms as the rest of his family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we are
entirely at your disposal. Hurry&mdash;hurry, before things get
disarranged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by
themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large sitting-room; above, his
bedroom. They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up to the windows. We
had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely
undisturbed. Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty
March morning. It has left an impression which can never be effaced from my
mind.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. The
servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been
even more intolerable. This might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood
flaring and smoking on the centre table. Beside it sat the dead man, leaning
back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to
his forehead, and his lean dark face turned towards the window and twisted into
the same distortion of terror which had marked the features of his dead sister.
His limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a
very paroxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his
dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his bed had been
slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning.
</p>

<p>
One realised the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes&rsquo;s phlegmatic
exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the moment
that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he was tense and alert, his
eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity. He was out
on the lawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom,
for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover. In the bedroom he
made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared
to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud
ejaculations of interest and delight. Then he rushed down the stair, out
through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and
into the room once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very
heels of his quarry. The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with
minute care, making certain measurements upon its bowl. He carefully
scrutinised with his lens the talc shield which covered the top of the chimney
and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of
them into an envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook. Finally, just as the
doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar
and we all three went out upon the lawn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely
barren,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I cannot remain to discuss the matter with
the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would
give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom
window and to the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive, and together they are
almost conclusive. If the police would desire further information I shall be
happy to see any of them at the cottage. And now, Watson, I think that,
perhaps, we shall be better employed elsewhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that they
imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation; but it is
certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two days. During this time
Holmes spent some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a
greater portion in country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many
hours without remark as to where he had been. One experiment served to show me
the line of his investigation. He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of
the one which had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of
the tragedy. This he filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and
he carefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted. Another
experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature, and one which I am
not likely ever to forget.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will remember, Watson,&rdquo; he remarked one afternoon, &ldquo;that
there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have
reached us. This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case
upon those who had first entered it. You will recollect that Mortimer
Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his brother&rsquo;s
house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair? You had
forgotten? Well I can answer for it that it was so. Now, you will remember also
that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon
entering the room and had afterwards opened the window. In the second
case&mdash;that of Mortimer Tregennis himself&mdash;you cannot have forgotten
the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the servant had
thrown open the window. That servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she
had gone to her bed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are very
suggestive. In each case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere. In each
case, also, there is combustion going on in the room&mdash;in the one case a
fire, in the other a lamp. The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit&mdash;as a
comparison of the oil consumed will show&mdash;long after it was broad
daylight. Why? Surely because there is some connection between three
things&mdash;the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or
death of those unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would appear so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. We will suppose,
then, that something was burned in each case which produced an atmosphere
causing strange toxic effects. Very good. In the first instance&mdash;that of
the Tregennis family&mdash;this substance was placed in the fire. Now the
window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the
chimney. Hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in
the second case, where there was less escape for the vapour. The result seems
to indicate that it was so, since in the first case only the woman, who had
presumably the more sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that
temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug.
In the second case the result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to bear
out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in
Mortimer Tregennis&rsquo;s room to find some remains of this substance. The
obvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp. There,
sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe
of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed. Half of this I took, as
you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why half, Holmes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official
police force. I leave them all the evidence which I found. The poison still
remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it. Now, Watson, we will light
our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open our window to avoid the
premature decease of two deserving members of society, and you will seat
yourself near that open window in an armchair unless, like a sensible man, you
determine to have nothing to do with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will
you? I thought I knew my Watson. This chair I will place opposite yours, so
that we may be the same distance from the poison and face to face. The door we
will leave ajar. Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the
experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is that all clear?
Well, then, I take our powder&mdash;or what remains of it&mdash;from the
envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us sit down
and await developments.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were not long in coming. I had hardly settled in my chair before I was
conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the very first whiff
of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control. A thick, black cloud
swirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud, unseen as yet,
but about to spring out upon my appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely
horrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.
Vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a
warning of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the
threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul. A freezing horror took
possession of me. I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes were protruding,
that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather. The turmoil within my
brain was such that something must surely snap. I tried to scream and was
vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant and
detached from myself. At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke
through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse of Holmes&rsquo;s face, white,
rigid, and drawn with horror&mdash;the very look which I had seen upon the
features of the dead. It was that vision which gave me an instant of sanity and
of strength. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together
we lurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves
down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the
glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of
terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from
a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the
grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at each other
to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word, Watson!&rdquo; said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice,
&ldquo;I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable
experiment even for one&rsquo;s self, and doubly so for a friend. I am really
very sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so
much of Holmes&rsquo;s heart before, &ldquo;that it is my greatest joy and
privilege to help you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was his
habitual attitude to those about him. &ldquo;It would be superfluous to drive
us mad, my dear Watson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A candid observer would
certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an
experiment. I confess that I never imagined that the effect could be so sudden
and so severe.&rdquo; He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the
burning lamp held at full arm&rsquo;s length, he threw it among a bank of
brambles. &ldquo;We must give the room a little time to clear. I take it,
Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies
were produced?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour here
and let us discuss it together. That villainous stuff seems still to linger
round my throat. I think we must admit that all the evidence points to this
man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy, though
he was the victim in the second one. We must remember, in the first place, that
there is some story of a family quarrel, followed by a reconciliation. How
bitter that quarrel may have been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot
tell. When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small
shrewd, beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge
to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you
will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our
attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated from him.
He had a motive in misleading us. Finally, if he did not throw the substance
into the fire at the moment of leaving the room, who did do so? The affair
happened immediately after his departure. Had anyone else come in, the family
would certainly have risen from the table. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall,
visitors did not arrive after ten o&rsquo;clock at night. We may take it, then,
that all the evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then his own death was suicide!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition. The
man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own
family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself. There are,
however, some cogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one man in
England who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by which we shall
hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his
time. Perhaps you would kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been
conducing a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly
fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure of the
great African explorer appeared upon the path. He turned in some surprise
towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note about an hour ago, and I
have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,&rdquo; said
Holmes. &ldquo;Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous
acquiescence. You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my
friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the
papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the
present. Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you
personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk where
there can be no eavesdropping.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am at a loss to know, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what you can have to
speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I wished that I were armed. Sterndale&rsquo;s fierce face turned
to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins started out
in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my
companion. Then he stopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid
calmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed
outburst.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that I have got into the way of being a law to myself. You would do
well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an
injury.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the
clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you and not
for the police.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time in his
adventurous life. There was a calm assurance of power in Holmes&rsquo;s manner
which could not be withstood. Our visitor stammered for a moment, his great
hands opening and shutting in his agitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked at last. &ldquo;If this is bluff upon
your part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us
have no more beating about the bush. What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;and the reason why I tell
you is that I hope frankness may beget frankness. What my next step may be will
depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My defence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My defence against what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. &ldquo;Upon my word, you
are getting on,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do all your successes depend upon this
prodigious power of bluff?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bluff,&rdquo; said Holmes sternly, &ldquo;is upon your side, Dr.
Leon Sterndale, and not upon mine. As a proof I will tell you some of the facts
upon which my conclusions are based. Of your return from Plymouth, allowing
much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say nothing save that it first
informed me that you were one of the factors which had to be taken into account
in reconstructing this drama&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I came back&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and
inadequate. We will pass that. You came down here to ask me whom I suspected. I
refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage, waited outside it for
some time, and finally returned to your cottage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I followed you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw no one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is what you may expect to see when I follow you. You spent a
restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in the
early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your door just as
day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was
lying heaped beside your gate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the
vicarage. You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes
which are at the present moment upon your feet. At the vicarage you passed
through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out under the window of the
lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the household was not yet stirring.
You drew some of the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at the window
above you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sterndale sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe that you are the devil himself!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
Holmes smiled at the compliment. &ldquo;It took two, or possibly three,
handfuls before the lodger came to the window. You beckoned him to come down.
He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. You entered by the
window. There was an interview&mdash;a short one&mdash;during which you walked
up and down the room. Then you passed out and closed the window, standing on
the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred. Finally, after the
death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you had come. Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do
you justify such conduct, and what were the motives for your actions? If you
prevaricate or trifle with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will
pass out of my hands forever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our visitor&rsquo;s face had turned ashen grey as he listened to the words of
his accuser. Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his
hands. Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a photograph from his
breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is why I have done it,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman. Holmes stooped over it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Brenda Tregennis,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Brenda Tregennis,&rdquo; repeated our visitor. &ldquo;For years I
have loved her. For years she has loved me. There is the secret of that Cornish
seclusion which people have marvelled at. It has brought me close to the one
thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for I have a wife
who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable laws of England, I
could not divorce. For years Brenda waited. For years I waited. And this is
what we have waited for.&rdquo; A terrible sob shook his great frame, and he
clutched his throat under his brindled beard. Then with an effort he mastered
himself and spoke on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The vicar knew. He was in our confidence. He would tell you that she was
an angel upon earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned. What was
my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such a fate had come upon my
darling? There you have the missing clue to my action, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said my friend.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table.
On the outside was written &ldquo;<i>Radix pedis diaboli</i>&rdquo; with a red
poison label beneath it. He pushed it towards me. &ldquo;I understand that you
are a doctor, sir. Have you ever heard of this preparation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s-foot root! No, I have never heard of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there
is no other specimen in Europe. It has not yet found its way either into the
pharmacopœia or into the literature of toxicology. The root is shaped like a
foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given by a botanical
missionary. It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine-men in certain
districts of West Africa and is kept as a secret among them. This particular
specimen I obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi
country.&rdquo; He opened the paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of
reddish-brown, snuff-like powder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; asked Holmes sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for you
already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you should know
all. I have already explained the relationship in which I stood to the
Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers.
There was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but
it was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the others. He
was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and several things arose which gave me a
suspicion of him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I
showed him some of my African curiosities. Among other things I exhibited this
powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it stimulates those brain
centres which control the emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is
the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of
his tribe. I told him also how powerless European science would be to detect
it. How he took it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no
doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes,
that he managed to abstract some of the devil&rsquo;s-foot root. I well
remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was
needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a personal
reason for asking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought no more of the matter until the vicar&rsquo;s telegram reached
me at Plymouth. This villain had thought that I would be at sea before the news
could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa. But I returned
at once. Of course, I could not listen to the details without feeling assured
that my poison had been used. I came round to see you on the chance that some
other explanation had suggested itself to you. But there could be none. I was
convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money,
and with the idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all
insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the
devil&rsquo;s-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,
and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever loved or who
has ever loved me. There was his crime; what was to be his punishment?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Should I appeal to the law? Where were my proofs? I knew that the facts
were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe so fantastic a
story? I might or I might not. But I could not afford to fail. My soul cried
out for revenge. I have said to you once before, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent
much of my life outside the law, and that I have come at last to be a law to
myself. So it was even now. I determined that the fate which he had given to
others should be shared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him
with my own hand. In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon
his own life than I do at the present moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I have told you all. You have yourself supplied the rest. I did, as
you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage. I foresaw the
difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from the pile which you
have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his window. He came down and
admitted me through the window of the sitting-room. I laid his offence before
him. I told him that I had come both as judge and executioner. The wretch sank
into a chair, paralysed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the
powder above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to
shoot him should he try to leave the room. In five minutes he died. My God! how
he died! But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my innocent
darling had not felt before him. There is my story, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps, if you
loved a woman, you would have done as much yourself. At any rate, I am in your
hands. You can take what steps you like. As I have already said, there is no
man living who can fear death less than I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes sat for some little time in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What were your plans?&rdquo; he asked at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had intended to bury myself in central Africa. My work there is but
half finished.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go and do the other half,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I, at least, am not
prepared to prevent you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from the
arbour. Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which
we are called upon to interfere. Our investigation has been independent, and
our action shall be so also. You would not denounce the man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had
met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done. Who
knows? Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is
obvious. The gravel upon the window-sill was, of course, the starting-point of
my research. It was unlike anything in the vicarage garden. Only when my
attention had been drawn to Dr. Sterndale and his cottage did I find its
counterpart. The lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon
the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain. And now, my dear
Watson, I think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a
clear conscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be
traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.&rdquo;

<h3><a name="chap04"></a>The Adventure of the Red Circle</h3>

<h4> PART I </h4>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for
uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value, should
interfere in the matter. I really have other things to engage me.&rdquo; So
spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook in which he was
arranging and indexing some of his recent material.
</p>

<p>
But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex. She held
her ground firmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,&rdquo; she
said&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Fairdale Hobbs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;a simple matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he would never cease talking of it&mdash;your kindness, sir, and the
way in which you brought light into the darkness. I remembered his words when I
was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if you only would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him justice,
upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay down his gum-brush
with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then. You don&rsquo;t
object to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson&mdash;the matches! You are
uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you
cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often
would not see me for weeks on end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No doubt, sir; but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. I
can&rsquo;t sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving
there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so much as a
glimpse of him&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than I can stand. My husband is as nervous
over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get no rest from
it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for the girl, I am all
alone in the house with him, and it&rsquo;s more than my nerves can
stand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman&rsquo;s
shoulder. He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished. The
scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed into their
usual commonplace. She sat down in the chair which he had indicated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I take it up I must understand every detail,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Take time to consider. The smallest point may be the most essential. You
say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight&rsquo;s board
and lodging?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He asked my terms, sir. I said fifty shillings a week. There is a small
sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it
on my own terms.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns
little, and the money meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note, and he
held it out to me then and there. &lsquo;You can have the same every fortnight
for a long time to come if you keep the terms,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If not,
I&rsquo;ll have no more to do with you.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What were the terms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was
all right. Lodgers often have them. Also, that he was to be left entirely to
himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing wonderful in that, surely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason. He has been there for
ten days, and neither Mr. Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set eyes upon
him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down, up and down, night,
morning, and noon; but except on that first night he had never once gone out of
the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he went out the first night, did he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, and returned very late&mdash;after we were all in bed. He told
me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the
door. I heard him come up the stair after midnight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But his meals?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang,
leave his meal upon a chair, outside his door. Then he rings again when he has
finished, and we take it down from the same chair. If he wants anything else he
prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Prints it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; prints it in pencil. Just the word, nothing more. Here&rsquo;s
the one I brought to show you&mdash;SOAP. Here&rsquo;s another&mdash;MATCH.
This is one he left the first morning&mdash;DAILY GAZETTE. I leave that paper
with his breakfast every morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, Watson,&rdquo; said Homes, staring with great curiosity at the
slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, &ldquo;this is
certainly a little unusual. Seclusion I can understand; but why print? Printing
is a clumsy process. Why not write? What would it suggest, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That he desired to conceal his handwriting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why? What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a word
of his writing? Still, it may be as you say. Then, again, why such laconic
messages?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot imagine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. The words are
written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern.
You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the
printing was done, so that the &lsquo;S&rsquo; of &lsquo;SOAP&rsquo; is partly
gone. Suggestive, Watson, is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of caution?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something which
might give a clue to the person&rsquo;s identity. Now, Mrs. Warren, you say
that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded. What age would he
be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Youngish, sir&mdash;not over thirty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, can you give me no further indications?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by his
accent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he was well dressed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very smartly dressed, sir&mdash;quite the gentleman. Dark
clothes&mdash;nothing you would note.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He gave no name?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And has had no letters or callers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me! that is certainly remarkable. What about his luggage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had one big brown bag with him&mdash;nothing else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t seem to have much material to help us. Do you say
nothing has come out of that room&mdash;absolutely nothing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The landlady drew an envelope from her bag; from it she shook out two burnt
matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were on his tray this morning. I brought them because I had heard
that you can read great things out of small ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The matches have, of
course, been used to light cigarettes. That is obvious from the shortness of
the burnt end. Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar. But,
dear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable. The gentleman was bearded
and moustached, you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that. I should say that only a clean-shaven man
could have smoked this. Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would have been
singed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A holder?&rdquo; I suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; the end is matted. I suppose there could not be two people in
your rooms, Mrs. Warren?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir. He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I think we must wait for a little more material. After all, you
have nothing to complain of. You have received your rent, and he is not a
troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one. He pays you well,
and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours. We have
no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think
that there is a guilty reason for it. I&rsquo;ve taken up the matter, and I
won&rsquo;t lose sight of it. Report to me if anything fresh occurs, and rely
upon my assistance if it should be needed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,&rdquo;
he remarked when the landlady had left us. &ldquo;It may, of course, be
trivial&mdash;individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than
appears on the surface. The first thing that strikes one is the obvious
possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the
one who engaged them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should you think so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the only
time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms? He came
back&mdash;or someone came back&mdash;when all witnesses were out of the way.
We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out.
Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke English well. This other,
however, prints &lsquo;match&rsquo; when it should have been
&lsquo;matches.&rsquo; I can imagine that the word was taken out of a
dictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural. The laconic style may
be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English. Yes, Watson, there are good
reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But for what possible end?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! there lies our problem. There is one rather obvious line of
investigation.&rdquo; He took down the great book in which, day by day, he
filed the agony columns of the various London journals. &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo;
said he, turning over the pages, &ldquo;what a chorus of groans, cries, and
bleatings! What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But surely the most valuable
hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual! This person is
alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute
secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from
without? Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other
way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here
are the <i>Daily Gazette</i> extracts of the last fortnight. &lsquo;Lady with a
black boa at Prince&rsquo;s Skating Club&rsquo;&mdash;that we may pass.
&lsquo;Surely Jimmy will not break his mother&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;&mdash;that
appears to be irrelevant. &lsquo;If the lady who fainted on Brixton
bus&rsquo;&mdash;she does not interest me. &lsquo;Every day my heart
longs&mdash;&rsquo; Bleat, Watson&mdash;unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little
more possible. Listen to this: &lsquo;Be patient. Will find some sure means of
communications. Meanwhile, this column. G.&rsquo; That is two days after Mrs.
Warren&rsquo;s lodger arrived. It sounds plausible, does it not? The mysterious
one could understand English, even if he could not print it. Let us see if we
can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are&mdash;three days later. &lsquo;Am
making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass.
G.&rsquo; Nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more
definite: &lsquo;The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember
code agreed&mdash;One A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.&rsquo; That
was in yesterday&rsquo;s paper, and there is nothing in to-day&rsquo;s.
It&rsquo;s all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s lodger. If we wait a
little, Watson, I don&rsquo;t doubt that the affair will grow more
intelligible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the hearthrug
with his back to the fire and a smile of complete satisfaction upon his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Watson?&rdquo; he cried, picking up the paper from the
table. &ldquo;&lsquo;High red house with white stone facings. Third floor.
Second window left. After dusk. G.&rsquo; That is definite enough. I think
after breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s
neighbourhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy which told
of some new and momentous development.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a police matter, Mr. Holmes!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more of it! He shall pack out of there with his
baggage. I would have gone straight up and told him so, only I thought it was
but fair to you to take your opinion first. But I&rsquo;m at the end of my
patience, and when it comes to knocking my old man about&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Knocking Mr. Warren about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Using him roughly, anyway.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But who used him roughly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s what we want to know! It was this morning, sir. Mr.
Warren is a timekeeper at Morton and Waylight&rsquo;s, in Tottenham Court Road.
He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning he had not gone
ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him, threw a coat over his
head, and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb. They drove him an
hour, and then opened the door and shot him out. He lay in the roadway so
shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab. When he picked
himself up he found he was on Hampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there
he lies now on his sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had
happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most interesting,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Did he observe the
appearance of these men&mdash;did he hear them talk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he was lifted up as if by
magic and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe
three.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you connect this attack with your lodger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever
came before. I&rsquo;ve had enough of him. Money&rsquo;s not everything.
I&rsquo;ll have him out of my house before the day is done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rash. I begin to think that this
affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight. It is
clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger. It is equally clear that
his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door, mistook your husband for him
in the foggy morning light. On discovering their mistake they released him.
What they would have done had it not been a mistake, we can only
conjecture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the
door. I always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the
tray.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has to take the tray in. Surely we could conceal ourselves and see
him do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The landlady thought for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, there&rsquo;s the box-room opposite. I could arrange a
looking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;When does he lunch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About one, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time. For the present, Mrs.
Warren, good-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s
house&mdash;a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme Street, a narrow
thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British Museum. Standing as it does
near the corner of the street, it commands a view down Howe Street, with its
more pretentious houses. Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a row
of residential flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the
eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See, Watson!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;&lsquo;High red house with stone
facings.&rsquo; There is the signal station all right. We know the place, and
we know the code; so surely our task should be simple. There&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;to let&rsquo; card in that window. It is evidently an empty flat to
which the confederate has access. Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have it all ready for you. If you will both come up and leave your
boots below on the landing, I&rsquo;ll put you there now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged. The mirror was so
placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the door opposite.
We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left us, when a distant
tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had rung. Presently the landlady
appeared with the tray, laid it down upon a chair beside the closed door, and
then, treading heavily, departed. Crouching together in the angle of the door,
we kept our eyes fixed upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady&rsquo;s
footsteps died away, there was the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved,
and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray from the chair. An instant
later it was hurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful,
horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room. Then the door
crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes twitched my
sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will call again in the evening,&rdquo; said he to the expectant
landlady. &ldquo;I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our
own quarters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,&rdquo; said he, speaking
from the depths of his easy-chair. &ldquo;There has been a substitution of
lodgers. What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no ordinary
woman, Watson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She saw us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, she saw something to alarm her. That is certain. The general
sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge in London
from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that danger is the
rigour of their precautions. The man, who has some work which he must do,
desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it. It is not an
easy problem, but he solved it in an original fashion, and so effectively that
her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food. The
printed messages, as is now evident, were to prevent her sex being discovered
by her writing. The man cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their
enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to
the agony column of a paper. So far all is clear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what is at the root of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, Watson&mdash;severely practical, as usual! What is at the root
of it all? Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes
a more sinister aspect as we proceed. This much we can say: that it is no
ordinary love escapade. You saw the woman&rsquo;s face at the sign of danger.
We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was undoubtedly
meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy, argue
that the matter is one of life or death. The attack upon Mr. Warren further
shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the
substitution of the female lodger for the male. It is very curious and complex,
Watson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, indeed? It is art for art&rsquo;s sake, Watson. I suppose when you
doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For my education, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons with the
greatest for the last. This is an instructive case. There is neither money nor
credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When dusk comes we should
find ourselves one stage advanced in our investigation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When we returned to Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s rooms, the gloom of a London winter
evening had thickened into one grey curtain, a dead monotone of colour, broken
only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred haloes of the
gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of the lodging-house,
one more dim light glimmered high up through the obscurity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Someone is moving in that room,&rdquo; said Holmes in a whisper, his
gaunt and eager face thrust forward to the window-pane. &ldquo;Yes, I can see
his shadow. There he is again! He has a candle in his hand. Now he is peering
across. He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout. Now he begins to flash.
Take the message also, Watson, that we may check each other. A single
flash&mdash;that is A, surely. Now, then. How many did you make it? Twenty. So
did I. That should mean T. AT&mdash;that&rsquo;s intelligible enough. Another
T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word. Now, then&mdash;TENTA. Dead
stop. That can&rsquo;t be all, Watson? ATTENTA gives no sense. Nor is it any
better as three words AT, TEN, TA, unless T. A. are a person&rsquo;s initials.
There it goes again! What&rsquo;s that? ATTE&mdash;why, it is the same message
over again. Curious, Watson, very curious. Now he is off once more!
AT&mdash;why he is repeating it for the third time. ATTENTA three times! How
often will he repeat it? No, that seems to be the finish. He has withdrawn from
the window. What do you make of it, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A cipher message, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension. &ldquo;And not a very
obscure cipher, Watson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why, of course, it is Italian!
The A means that it is addressed to a woman. &lsquo;Beware! Beware!
Beware!&rsquo; How&rsquo;s that, Watson?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you have hit it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a doubt of it. It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to make
it more so. But beware of what? Wait a bit, he is coming to the window once
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the small
flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came more rapidly
than before&mdash;so rapid that it was hard to follow them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;PERICOLO&mdash;pericolo&mdash;eh, what&rsquo;s that, Watson?
&lsquo;Danger,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t it? Yes, by Jove, it&rsquo;s a danger signal.
There he goes again! PERI. Halloa, what on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had
disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty building,
with its tiers of shining casements. That last warning cry had been suddenly
cut short. How, and by whom? The same thought occurred on the instant to us
both. Holmes sprang up from where he crouched by the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is serious, Watson,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There is some devilry
going forward! Why should such a message stop in such a way? I should put
Scotland Yard in touch with this business&mdash;and yet, it is too pressing for
us to leave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I go for the police?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must define the situation a little more clearly. It may bear some
more innocent interpretation. Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves and see
what we can make of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<h4> PART II </h4>

<p>
As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building which we
had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see the shadow of a
head, a woman&rsquo;s head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into the night,
waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message.
At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and
greatcoat, was leaning against the railing. He started as the hall-light fell
upon our faces.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holmes!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Gregson!&rdquo; said my companion as he shook hands with the
Scotland Yard detective. &ldquo;Journeys end with lovers&rsquo; meetings. What
brings you here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The same reasons that bring you, I expect,&rdquo; said Gregson.
&ldquo;How you got on to it I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle. I&rsquo;ve been
taking the signals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Signals?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, from that window. They broke off in the middle. We came over to see
the reason. But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing
this business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; cried Gregson eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you this
justice, Mr. Holmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn&rsquo;t feel
stronger for having you on my side. There&rsquo;s only the one exit to these
flats, so we have him safe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us
best this time.&rdquo; He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which a
cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a four-wheeler which stood on
the far side of the street. &ldquo;May I introduce you to Mr. Sherlock
Holmes?&rdquo; he said to the cabman. &ldquo;This is Mr. Leverton, of
Pinkerton&rsquo;s American Agency.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?&rdquo; said Holmes.
&ldquo;Sir, I am pleased to meet you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven, hatchet
face, flushed up at the words of commendation. &ldquo;I am on the trail of my
life now, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I can get
Gorgiano&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! Gorgiano of the Red Circle?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he has a European fame, has he? Well, we&rsquo;ve learned all about
him in America. We <i>know</i> he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we
have nothing positive we can take him on. I tracked him over from New York, and
I&rsquo;ve been close to him for a week in London, waiting some excuse to get
my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement
house, and there&rsquo;s only one door, so he can&rsquo;t slip us.
There&rsquo;s three folk come out since he went in, but I&rsquo;ll swear he
wasn&rsquo;t one of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Holmes talks of signals,&rdquo; said Gregson. &ldquo;I expect, as
usual, he knows a good deal that we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared to us.
The American struck his hands together with vexation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on to us!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it figures out that way, does it not? Here he is, sending out
messages to an accomplice&mdash;there are several of his gang in London. Then
suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that there was
danger, he broke short off. What could it mean except that from the window he
had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street, or in some way come to
understand how close the danger was, and that he must act right away if he was
to avoid it? What do you suggest, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That we go up at once and see for ourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we have no warrant for his arrest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,&rdquo; said
Gregson. &ldquo;That is good enough for the moment. When we have him by the
heels we can see if New York can&rsquo;t help us to keep him. I&rsquo;ll take
the responsibility of arresting him now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but never in
that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer
with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would
have ascended the official staircase of Scotland Yard. The Pinkerton man had
tried to push past him, but Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. London dangers
were the privilege of the London force.
</p>

<p>
The door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing ajar.
Gregson pushed it open. Within all was absolute silence and darkness. I struck
a match and lit the detective&rsquo;s lantern. As I did so, and as the flicker
steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of surprise. On the deal boards of
the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood. The red steps
pointed towards us and led away from an inner room, the door of which was
closed. Gregson flung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him,
while we all peered eagerly over his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of an
enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in its
contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of blood, lying in
a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn up, his hands
thrown out in agony, and from the centre of his broad, brown, upturned throat
there projected the white haft of a knife driven blade-deep into his body.
Giant as he was, the man must have gone down like a pole-axed ox before that
terrific blow. Beside his right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged
dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By George! it&rsquo;s Black Gorgiano himself!&rdquo; cried the American
detective. &ldquo;Someone has got ahead of us this time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said Gregson.
&ldquo;Why, whatever are you doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it backward and
forward across the window-panes. Then he peered into the darkness, blew the
candle out, and threw it on the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I rather think that will be helpful,&rdquo; said he. He came over and
stood in deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body.
&ldquo;You say that three people came out from the flat while you were waiting
downstairs,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;Did you observe them closely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle
size?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he was the last to pass me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is your man, I fancy. I can give you his description, and we have a
very excellent outline of his footmark. That should be enough for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your
aid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We all turned round at the words. There, framed in the doorway, was a tall and
beautiful woman&mdash;the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury. Slowly she advanced,
her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension, her eyes fixed and
staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark figure on the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have killed him!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Oh, <i>Dio mio</i>, you
have killed him!&rdquo; Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and
she sprang into the air with a cry of joy. Round and round the room she danced,
her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a
thousand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her lips. It was terrible and
amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. Suddenly she
stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you! You are police, are you not? You have killed Giuseppe Gorgiano.
Is it not so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are police, madam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked round into the shadows of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But where, then, is Gennaro?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;He is my husband,
Gennaro Lucca. I am Emilia Lucca, and we are both from New York. Where is
Gennaro? He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all my
speed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was I who called,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You! How could you call?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your cipher was not difficult, madam. Your presence here was desirable.
I knew that I had only to flash &lsquo;<i>Vieni</i>&rsquo; and you would surely
come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The beautiful Italian looked with awe at my companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand how you know these things,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Giuseppe Gorgiano&mdash;how did he&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, and then
suddenly her face lit up with pride and delight. &ldquo;Now I see it! My
Gennaro! My splendid, beautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm,
he did it, with his own strong hand he killed the monster! Oh, Gennaro, how
wonderful you are! What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Lucca,&rdquo; said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon
the lady&rsquo;s sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill
hooligan, &ldquo;I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but
you&rsquo;ve said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the
Yard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One moment, Gregson,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I rather fancy that this
lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. You
understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death
of the man who lies before us? What you say may be used in evidence. But if you
think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal, and which he would
wish to have known, then you cannot serve him better than by telling us the
whole story.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,&rdquo; said the lady.
&ldquo;He was a devil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who
would punish my husband for having killed him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;my suggestion is that we lock
this door, leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and
form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to
us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room of
Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events,
the ending of which we had chanced to witness. She spoke in rapid and fluent
but very unconventional English, which, for the sake of clearness, I will make
grammatical.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was born in Posilippo, near Naples,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and was
the daughter of Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy
of that part. Gennaro was in my father&rsquo;s employment, and I came to love
him, as any woman must. He had neither money nor position&mdash;nothing but his
beauty and strength and energy&mdash;so my father forbade the match. We fled
together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the money which
would take us to America. This was four years ago, and we have been in New York
ever since.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fortune was very good to us at first. Gennaro was able to do a service
to an Italian gentleman&mdash;he saved him from some ruffians in the place
called the Bowery, and so made a powerful friend. His name was Tito Castalotte,
and he was the senior partner of the great firm of Castalotte and Zamba, who
are the chief fruit importers of New York. Signor Zamba is an invalid, and our
new friend Castalotte has all power within the firm, which employs more than
three hundred men. He took my husband into his employment, made him head of a
department, and showed his good-will towards him in every way. Signor
Castalotte was a bachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his
son, and both my husband and I loved him as if he were our father. We had taken
and furnished a little house in Brooklyn, and our whole future seemed assured
when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our sky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a
fellow-countryman back with him. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come also
from Posilippo. He was a huge man, as you can testify, for you have looked upon
his corpse. Not only was his body that of a giant but everything about him was
grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying. His voice was like thunder in our little
house. There was scarce room for the whirl of his great arms as he talked. His
thoughts, his emotions, his passions, all were exaggerated and monstrous. He
talked, or rather roared, with such energy that others could but sit and
listen, cowed with the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed at you and held
you at his mercy. He was a terrible and wonderful man. I thank God that he is
dead!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He came again and again. Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more happy
than I was in his presence. My poor husband would sit pale and listless,
listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social questions which
made up our visitor&rsquo;s conversation. Gennaro said nothing, but I, who knew
him so well, could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there
before. At first I thought that it was dislike. And then, gradually, I
understood that it was more than dislike. It was fear&mdash;a deep, secret,
shrinking fear. That night&mdash;the night that I read his terror&mdash;I put
my arms round him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held
dear to hold nothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him
so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened. My poor
Gennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against him and
his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had joined a Neapolitan
society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the old Carbonari. The oaths and
secrets of this brotherhood were frightful, but once within its rule no escape
was possible. When we had fled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it
all off forever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the
very man who had initiated him in Naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who had
earned the name of &lsquo;Death&rsquo; in the south of Italy, for he was red to
the elbow in murder! He had come to New York to avoid the Italian police, and
he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home. All
this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which he had received that very
day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it telling him that a lodge would be
held upon a certain date, and that his presence at it was required and ordered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was bad enough, but worse was to come. I had noticed for some time
that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the evening, he spoke
much to me; and even when his words were to my husband those terrible, glaring,
wild-beast eyes of his were always turned upon me. One night his secret came
out. I had awakened what he called &lsquo;love&rsquo; within him&mdash;the love
of a brute&mdash;a savage. Gennaro had not yet returned when he came. He pushed
his way in, seized me in his mighty arms, hugged me in his bear&rsquo;s
embrace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to come away with him. I was
struggling and screaming when Gennaro entered and attacked him. He struck
Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter. It
was a deadly enemy that we made that night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A few days later came the meeting. Gennaro returned from it with a face
which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse than we could
have imagined possible. The funds of the society were raised by blackmailing
rich Italians and threatening them with violence should they refuse the money.
It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend and benefactor, had been approached.
He had refused to yield to threats, and he had handed the notices to the
police. It was resolved now that such an example should be made of them as
would prevent any other victim from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged
that he and his house should be blown up with dynamite. There was a drawing of
lots as to who should carry out the deed. Gennaro saw our enemy&rsquo;s cruel
face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it had been
prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red Circle upon
it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his palm. He was to kill his best
friend, or he was to expose himself and me to the vengeance of his comrades. It
was part of their fiendish system to punish those whom they feared or hated by
injuring not only their own persons but those whom they loved, and it was the
knowledge of this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro&rsquo;s head and
drove him nearly crazy with apprehension.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each
strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next evening
had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my husband and I were on our way to
London, but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger,
and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life
for the future.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves. We were sure that our
enemies would be behind us like our own shadows. Gorgiano had his private
reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how ruthless, cunning, and
untiring he could be. Both Italy and America are full of stories of his
dreadful powers. If ever they were exerted it would be now. My darling made use
of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge
for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me. For his own
part, he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the American and
with the Italian police. I do not myself know where he lived, or how. All that
I learned was through the columns of a newspaper. But once as I looked through
my window, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I understood that in some
way Gorgiano had found our retreat. Finally Gennaro told me, through the paper,
that he would signal to me from a certain window, but when the signals came
they were nothing but warnings, which were suddenly interrupted. It is very
clear to me now that he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank
God! he was ready for him when he came. And now, gentleman, I would ask you
whether we have anything to fear from the law, or whether any judge upon earth
would condemn my Gennaro for what he has done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Gregson,&rdquo; said the American, looking across at the
official, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your British point of view may be, but
I guess that in New York this lady&rsquo;s husband will receive a pretty
general vote of thanks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will have to come with me and see the chief,&rdquo; Gregson
answered. &ldquo;If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her
husband has much to fear. But what I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of, Mr.
Holmes, is how on earth <i>you</i> got yourself mixed up in the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Education, Gregson, education. Still seeking knowledge at the old
university. Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and
grotesque to add to your collection. By the way, it is not eight o&rsquo;clock,
and a Wagner night at Covent Garden! If we hurry, we might be in time for the
second act.&rdquo;

<h3><a name="chap05"></a>The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;But why Turkish?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my
boots. I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my protruded
feet had attracted his ever-active attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;English,&rdquo; I answered in some surprise. &ldquo;I got them at
Latimer&rsquo;s, in Oxford Street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bath!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the bath! Why the relaxing and
expensive Turkish rather than the invigorating home-made article?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. A
Turkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine&mdash;a fresh
starting-point, a cleanser of the system.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, Holmes,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I have no doubt the
connection between my boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one
to a logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes
with a mischievous twinkle. &ldquo;It belongs to the same elementary class of
deduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared your cab in
your drive this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation,&rdquo;
said I with some asperity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bravo, Watson! A very dignified and logical remonstrance. Let me see,
what were the points? Take the last one first&mdash;the cab. You observe that
you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat. Had you
sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no splashes, and if
you had they would certainly have been symmetrical. Therefore it is clear that
you sat at the side. Therefore it is equally clear that you had a
companion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is very evident.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Absurdly commonplace, is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the boots and the bath?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Equally childish. You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a
certain way. I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate double bow,
which is not your usual method of tying them. You have, therefore, had them
off. Who has tied them? A bootmaker&mdash;or the boy at the bath. It is
unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots are nearly new. Well, what
remains? The bath. Absurd, is it not? But, for all that, the Turkish bath has
served a purpose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You say that you have had it because you need a change. Let me suggest
that you take one. How would Lausanne do, my dear Watson&mdash;first-class
tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendid! But why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of the most dangerous classes in the world,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is the drifting and friendless woman. She is the most harmless and often
the most useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in
others. She is helpless. She is migratory. She has sufficient means to take her
from country to country and from hotel to hotel. She is lost, as often as not,
in a maze of obscure <i>pensions</i> and boardinghouses. She is a stray chicken
in a world of foxes. When she is gobbled up she is hardly missed. I much fear
that some evil has come to the Lady Frances Carfax.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the particular.
Holmes consulted his notes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lady Frances,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is the sole survivor of the
direct family of the late Earl of Rufton. The estates went, as you may
remember, in the male line. She was left with limited means, but with some very
remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut diamonds to which
she was fondly attached&mdash;too attached, for she refused to leave them with
her banker and always carried them about with her. A rather pathetic figure,
the Lady Frances, a beautiful woman, still in fresh middle age, and yet, by a
strange change, the last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a goodly
fleet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What has happened to her, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances? Is she alive or dead? There
is our problem. She is a lady of precise habits, and for four years it has been
her invariable custom to write every second week to Miss Dobney, her old
governess, who has long retired and lives in Camberwell. It is this Miss Dobney
who has consulted me. Nearly five weeks have passed without a word. The last
letter was from the Hôtel National at Lausanne. Lady Frances seems to have left
there and given no address. The family are anxious, and as they are exceedingly
wealthy no sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Miss Dobney the only source of information? Surely she had other
correspondents?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson. That is the bank.
Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed diaries. She banks
at Silvester&rsquo;s. I have glanced over her account. The last check but one
paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large one and probably left her with
cash in hand. Only one check has been drawn since.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To whom, and where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to show where the check was
drawn. It was cashed at the Crédit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than three
weeks ago. The sum was fifty pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who is Miss Marie Devine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That also I have been able to discover. Miss Marie Devine was the maid
of Lady Frances Carfax. Why she should have paid her this check we have not yet
determined. I have no doubt, however, that your researches will soon clear the
matter up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>My</i> researches!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne. You know that I cannot
possibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of his life.
Besides, on general principles it is best that I should not leave the country.
Scotland Yard feels lonely without me, and it causes an unhealthy excitement
among the criminal classes. Go, then, my dear Watson, and if my humble counsel
can ever be valued at so extravagant a rate as two pence a word, it waits your
disposal night and day at the end of the Continental wire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
Two days later found me at the Hôtel National at Lausanne, where I received
every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known manager. Lady Frances,
as he informed me, had stayed there for several weeks. She had been much liked
by all who met her. Her age was not more than forty. She was still handsome and
bore every sign of having in her youth been a very lovely woman. M. Moser knew
nothing of any valuable jewellery, but it had been remarked by the servants
that the heavy trunk in the lady&rsquo;s bedroom was always scrupulously
locked. Marie Devine, the maid, was as popular as her mistress. She was
actually engaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and there was no
difficulty in getting her address. It was 11, Rue de Trajan, Montpellier. All
this I jotted down and felt that Holmes himself could not have been more adroit
in collecting his facts.
</p>

<p>
Only one corner still remained in the shadow. No light which I possessed could
clear up the cause for the lady&rsquo;s sudden departure. She was very happy at
Lausanne. There was every reason to believe that she intended to remain for the
season in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake. And yet she had left at a
single day&rsquo;s notice, which involved her in the useless payment of a
week&rsquo;s rent. Only Jules Vibart, the lover of the maid, had any suggestion
to offer. He connected the sudden departure with the visit to the hotel a day
or two before of a tall, dark, bearded man. &ldquo;<i>Un sauvage&mdash;un
veritable sauvage!</i>&rdquo; cried Jules Vibart. The man had rooms somewhere
in the town. He had been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the promenade by
the lake. Then he had called. She had refused to see him. He was English, but
of his name there was no record. Madame had left the place immediately
afterwards. Jules Vibart, and, what was of more importance, Jules
Vibart&rsquo;s sweetheart, thought that this call and the departure were cause
and effect. Only one thing Jules would not discuss. That was the reason why
Marie had left her mistress. Of that he could or would say nothing. If I wished
to know, I must go to Montpellier and ask her.
</p>

<p>
So ended the first chapter of my inquiry. The second was devoted to the place
which Lady Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne. Concerning this
there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea that she had gone with
the intention of throwing someone off her track. Otherwise why should not her
luggage have been openly labelled for Baden? Both she and it reached the
Rhenish spa by some circuitous route. This much I gathered from the manager of
Cook&rsquo;s local office. So to Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes an
account of all my proceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of
half-humorous commendation.
</p>

<p>
At Baden the track was not difficult to follow. Lady Frances had stayed at the
Englischer Hof for a fortnight. While there she had made the acquaintance of a
Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from South America. Like most lonely
ladies, Lady Frances found her comfort and occupation in religion. Dr.
Shlessinger&rsquo;s remarkable personality, his whole hearted devotion, and the
fact that he was recovering from a disease contracted in the exercise of his
apostolic duties affected her deeply. She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the
nursing of the convalescent saint. He spent his day, as the manager described
it to me, upon a lounge-chair on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon
either side of him. He was preparing a map of the Holy Land, with special
reference to the kingdom of the Midianites, upon which he was writing a
monograph. Finally, having improved much in health, he and his wife had
returned to London, and Lady Frances had started thither in their company. This
was just three weeks before, and the manager had heard nothing since. As to the
maid, Marie, she had gone off some days beforehand in floods of tears, after
informing the other maids that she was leaving service forever. Dr. Shlessinger
had paid the bill of the whole party before his departure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the landlord in conclusion, &ldquo;you are not
the only friend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now.
Only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he give a name?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A savage?&rdquo; said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my
illustrious friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded, sunburned
fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers&rsquo; inn than
in a fashionable hotel. A hard, fierce man, I should think, and one whom I
should be sorry to offend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer with the
lifting of a fog. Here was this good and pious lady pursued from place to place
by a sinister and unrelenting figure. She feared him, or she would not have
fled from Lausanne. He had still followed. Sooner or later he would overtake
her. Had he already overtaken her? Was <i>that</i> the secret of her continued
silence? Could the good people who were her companions not screen her from his
violence or his blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind
this long pursuit? There was the problem which I had to solve.
</p>

<p>
To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the roots of
the matter. In reply I had a telegram asking for a description of Dr.
Shlessinger&rsquo;s left ear. Holmes&rsquo;s ideas of humour are strange and
occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest&mdash;indeed,
I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his
message came.
</p>

<p>
I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that she
could tell me. She was a devoted creature, who had only left her mistress
because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because her own
approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case. Her mistress
had, as she confessed with distress, shown some irritability of temper towards
her during their stay in Baden, and had even questioned her once as if she had
suspicions of her honesty, and this had made the parting easier than it would
otherwise have been. Lady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a
wedding-present. Like me, Marie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had
driven her mistress from Lausanne. With her own eyes she had seen him seize the
lady&rsquo;s wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake. He
was a fierce and terrible man. She believed that it was out of dread of him
that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the Shlessingers to London. She
had never spoken to Marie about it, but many little signs had convinced the
maid that her mistress lived in a state of continual nervous apprehension. So
far she had got in her narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and
her face was convulsed with surprise and fear. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;The miscreant follows still! There is the very man of whom I
speak.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a bristling
black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and staring eagerly at
the numbers of the houses. It was clear that, like myself, he was on the track
of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the moment, I rushed out and accosted
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are an Englishman,&rdquo; I said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if I am?&rdquo; he asked with a most villainous scowl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I ask what your name is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you may not,&rdquo; said he with decision.
</p>

<p>
The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
He stared at me with amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you done with her? Why have you pursued her? I insist upon an
answer!&rdquo; said I.
</p>

<p>
The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I have held
my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the fury of a
fiend. His hand was on my throat and my senses were nearly gone before an
unshaven French <i>ouvrier</i> in a blue blouse darted out from a
<i>cabaret</i> opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my assailant a
sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his hold. He stood for an
instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he should not renew his attack.
Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me and entered the cottage from which I
had just come. I turned to thank my preserver, who stood beside me in the
roadway.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Watson,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a very pretty hash you have made of
it! I rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night
express.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was seated in
my private room at the hotel. His explanation of his sudden and opportune
appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he could get away from
London, he determined to head me off at the next obvious point of my travels.
In the disguise of a workingman he had sat in the <i>cabaret</i> waiting for my
appearance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear
Watson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I cannot at the moment recall any possible
blunder which you have omitted. The total effect of your proceeding has been to
give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you would have done no better,&rdquo; I answered bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo; about it. I <i>have</i> done better.
Here is the Hon. Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel,
and we may find him the starting-point for a more successful
investigation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded ruffian
who had attacked me in the street. He started when he saw me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I had your note and I
have come. But what has this man to do with the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in
this affair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of apology.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t harm you. When you accused me of hurting her I
lost my grip of myself. Indeed, I&rsquo;m not responsible in these days. My
nerves are like live wires. But this situation is beyond me. What I want to
know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of
my existence at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances&rsquo;s governess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! I remember her well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And she remembers you. It was in the days before&mdash;before you found
it better to go to South Africa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I see you know my whole story. I need hide nothing from you. I swear
to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who loved a woman
with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances. I was a wild youngster, I
know&mdash;not worse than others of my class. But her mind was pure as snow.
She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. So, when she came to hear of things
that I had done, she would have no more to say to me. And yet she loved
me&mdash;that is the wonder of it!&mdash;loved me well enough to remain single
all her sainted days just for my sake alone. When the years had passed and I
had made my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and
soften her. I had heard that she was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne
and tried all I knew. She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and when
next I called she had left the town. I traced her to Baden, and then after a
time heard that her maid was here. I&rsquo;m a rough fellow, fresh from a rough
life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself for a
moment. But for God&rsquo;s sake tell me what has become of the Lady
Frances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is for us to find out,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar
gravity. &ldquo;What is your London address, Mr. Green?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Langham Hotel will find me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I
should want you? I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may rest
assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of Lady Frances.
I can say no more for the instant. I will leave you this card so that you may
be able to keep in touch with us. Now, Watson, if you will pack your bag I will
cable to Mrs. Hudson to make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers
at 7:30 to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms, which Holmes
read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to me. &ldquo;Jagged or
torn,&rdquo; was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is everything,&rdquo; Holmes answered. &ldquo;You may remember my
seemingly irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman&rsquo;s left ear.
You did not answer it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had left Baden and could not inquire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the
Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does it show?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally
astute and dangerous man. The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from South
America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most unscrupulous rascals
that Australia has ever evolved&mdash;and for a young country it has turned out
some very finished types. His particular specialty is the beguiling of lonely
ladies by playing upon their religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an
Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy helpmate. The nature of his tactics
suggested his identity to me, and this physical peculiarity&mdash;he was badly
bitten in a saloon-fight at Adelaide in &rsquo;89&mdash;confirmed my suspicion.
This poor lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at
nothing, Watson. That she is already dead is a very likely supposition. If not,
she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement and unable to write to Miss
Dobney or her other friends. It is always possible that she never reached
London, or that she has passed through it, but the former is improbable, as,
with their system of registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks
with the Continental police; and the latter is also unlikely, as these rogues
could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to keep a
person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is in London, but as
we have at present no possible means of telling where, we can only take the
obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience. Later in the
evening I will stroll down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland
Yard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But neither the official police nor Holmes&rsquo;s own small but very efficient
organisation sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the crowded millions of
London the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated as if they
had never lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed. Clues were followed,
and led to nothing. Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was
drawn in vain. His old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him. And
then suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of light. A
silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been pawned at
Bovington&rsquo;s, in Westminster Road. The pawner was a large, clean-shaven
man of clerical appearance. His name and address were demonstrably false. The
ear had escaped notice, but the description was surely that of Shlessinger.
</p>

<p>
Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news&mdash;the
third time within an hour of this fresh development. His clothes were getting
looser on his great body. He seemed to be wilting away in his anxiety.
&ldquo;If you will only give me something to do!&rdquo; was his constant wail.
At last Holmes could oblige him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should get him now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes shook his head very gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that
they cannot let her loose without their own destruction. We must prepare for
the worst.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These people do not know you by sight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future.
In that case, we must begin again. On the other hand, he has had a fair price
and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money he will probably
come back to Bovington&rsquo;s. I will give you a note to them, and they will
let you wait in the shop. If the fellow comes you will follow him home. But no
indiscretion, and, above all, no violence. I put you on your honour that you
will take no step without my knowledge and consent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of the
famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in the Crimean
War) brought us no news. On the evening of the third he rushed into our
sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his powerful frame
quivering with excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have him! We have him!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
He was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes soothed him with a few words and
thrust him into an armchair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, now, give us the order of events,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She came only an hour ago. It was the wife, this time, but the pendant
she brought was the fellow of the other. She is a tall, pale woman, with ferret
eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the lady,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She left the office and I followed her. She walked up the Kennington
Road, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr. Holmes, it was
an undertaker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My companion started. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked in that vibrant voice which
told of the fiery soul behind the cold grey face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well.
&lsquo;It is late,&rsquo; I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman
was excusing herself. &lsquo;It should be there before now,&rsquo; she
answered. &lsquo;It took longer, being out of the ordinary.&rsquo; They both
stopped and looked at me, so I asked some questions and then left the
shop.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did excellently well. What happened next?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway. Her suspicions
had been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a cab and
got in. I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her. She got down at
last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton. I drove past, left my cab at the
corner of the square, and watched the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you see anyone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The blind
was down, and I could not see in. I was standing there, wondering what I should
do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it. They descended, took
something out of the van, and carried it up the steps to the hall door. Mr.
Holmes, it was a coffin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For an instant I was on the point of rushing in. The door had been
opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it.
But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she
recognised me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. I remembered
my promise to you, and here I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have done excellent work,&rdquo; said Holmes, scribbling a few words
upon a half-sheet of paper. &ldquo;We can do nothing legal without a warrant,
and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities
and getting one. There may be some difficulty, but I should think that the sale
of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade will see to all details.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they may murder her in the meanwhile. What could the coffin mean,
and for whom could it be but for her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green. Not a moment will be lost.
Leave it in our hands. Now, Watson,&rdquo; he added as our client hurried away,
&ldquo;he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual, the
irregulars, and we must take our own line of action. The situation strikes me
as so desperate that the most extreme measures are justified. Not a moment is
to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us try to reconstruct the situation,&rdquo; said he as we drove
swiftly past the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge. &ldquo;These
villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first alienating her
from her faithful maid. If she has written any letters they have been
intercepted. Through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house. Once
inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and they have become possessed of the
valuable jewellery which has been their object from the first. Already they
have begun to sell part of it, which seems safe enough to them, since they have
no reason to think that anyone is interested in the lady&rsquo;s fate. When she
is released she will, of course, denounce them. Therefore, she must not be
released. But they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is
their only solution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That seems very clear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now we will take another line of reasoning. When you follow two separate
chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of intersection which
should approximate to the truth. We will start now, not from the lady but from
the coffin and argue backward. That incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt
that the lady is dead. It points also to an orthodox burial with proper
accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanction. Had the lady been
obviously murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden.
But here all is open and regular. What does this mean? Surely that they have
done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and simulated a
natural end&mdash;poisoning, perhaps. And yet how strange that they should ever
let a doctor approach her unless he were a confederate, which is hardly a
credible proposition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could they have forged a medical certificate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I hardly see them doing that.
Pull up, cabby! This is evidently the undertaker&rsquo;s, for we have just
passed the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. Would you go in, Watson? Your appearance
inspires confidence. Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes place
to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be at eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning. &ldquo;You see, Watson, no mystery; everything
above-board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with,
and they think that they have little to fear. Well, there&rsquo;s nothing for
it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you armed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My stick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, we shall be strong enough. &lsquo;Thrice is he armed who
hath his quarrel just.&rsquo; We simply can&rsquo;t afford to wait for the
police or to keep within the four corners of the law. You can drive off, cabby.
Now, Watson, we&rsquo;ll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally
in the past.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of Poultney
Square. It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall woman was outlined
against the dim-lit hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; she asked sharply, peering at us through
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no such person here,&rdquo; she answered, and tried to close
the door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call
himself,&rdquo; said Holmes firmly.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated. Then she threw open the door. &ldquo;Well, come in!&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.&rdquo; She
closed the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side
of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us. &ldquo;Mr. Peters will be with
you in an instant,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around the dusty
and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before the door opened and
a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly into the room. He had a
large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a general air of superficial
benevolence which was marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in an
unctuous, make-everything-easy voice. &ldquo;I fancy that you have been
misdirected. Possibly if you tried farther down the street&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That will do; we have no time to waste,&rdquo; said my companion firmly.
&ldquo;You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of
Baden and South America. I am as sure of that as that my own name is Sherlock
Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his formidable
pursuer. &ldquo;I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said
he coolly. &ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s conscience is easy you can&rsquo;t rattle
him. What is your business in my house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom you
brought away with you from Baden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may
be,&rdquo; Peters answered coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bill against her for
nearly a hundred pounds, and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery
pendants that the dealer would hardly look at. She attached herself to Mrs.
Peters and me at Baden&mdash;it is a fact that I was using another name at the
time&mdash;and she stuck on to us until we came to London. I paid her bill and
her ticket. Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these
out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I&rsquo;m
your debtor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>mean</i> to find her,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going through this house till I do find her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is your warrant?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket. &ldquo;This will have to serve
till a better one comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re a common burglar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you might describe me,&rdquo; said Holmes cheerfully. &ldquo;My
companion is also a dangerous ruffian. And together we are going through your
house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our opponent opened the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fetch a policeman, Annie!&rdquo; said he. There was a whisk of feminine
skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our time is limited, Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;If you try to
stop us, Peters, you will most certainly get hurt. Where is that coffin which
was brought into your house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want with the coffin? It is in use. There is a body in
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must see the body.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never with my consent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then without it.&rdquo; With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow
to one side and passed into the hall. A door half opened stood immediately
before us. We entered. It was the dining-room. On the table, under a half-lit
chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and raised the lid.
Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure. The glare from
the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible
process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the
still beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes&rsquo;s face showed his amazement, and
also his relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s someone else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo;
said Peters, who had followed us into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is the dead woman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife&rsquo;s,
Rose Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We
brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13, Firbank Villas&mdash;mind
you take the address, Mr. Holmes&mdash;and had her carefully tended, as
Christian folk should. On the third day she died&mdash;certificate says senile
decay&mdash;but that&rsquo;s only the doctor&rsquo;s opinion, and of course you
know better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson and Co., of
the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
morning. Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You&rsquo;ve made a silly
blunder, and you may as well own up to it. I&rsquo;d give something for a
photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid
expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found a poor old woman of
ninety.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes&rsquo;s expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his
antagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going through your house,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you, though!&rdquo; cried Peters as a woman&rsquo;s voice and heavy
steps sounded in the passage. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see about that. This way,
officers, if you please. These men have forced their way into my house, and I
cannot get rid of them. Help me to put them out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card from his
case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless you, sir, we know you very well,&rdquo; said the sergeant,
&ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t stay here without a warrant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. I quite understand that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Arrest him!&rdquo; cried Peters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,&rdquo;
said the sergeant majestically, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to go, Mr.
Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A minute later we were in the street once more. Holmes was as cool as ever, but
I was hot with anger and humiliation. The sergeant had followed us.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that&rsquo;s the law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect there was good reason for your presence there. If there is
anything I can do&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house.
I expect a warrant presently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes. If anything
comes along, I will surely let you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was only nine o&rsquo;clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at
once. First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found that it was
indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some days before, that
they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former servant, and that they had
obtained permission to take her away with them. No surprise was expressed at
the news that she had since died.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was our next goal. He had been called in, had found the woman dying
of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had signed the
certificate in due form. &ldquo;I assure you that everything was perfectly
normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,&rdquo; said he.
Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that for people of their
class it was remarkable that they should have no servant. So far and no further
went the doctor.
</p>

<p>
Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been difficulties of
procedure in regard to the warrant. Some delay was inevitable. The
magistrate&rsquo;s signature might not be obtained until next morning. If
Holmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it acted
upon. So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the sergeant,
called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and there in the windows
of the great dark house, but that no one had left it and none had entered. We
could but pray for patience and wait for the morrow.
</p>

<p>
Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for sleep.
I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted together, and his
long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his chair, as he turned over in
his mind every possible solution of the mystery. Several times in the course of
the night I heard him prowling about the house. Finally, just after I had been
called in the morning, he rushed into my room. He was in his dressing-gown, but
his pale, hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What time was the funeral? Eight, was it not?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
&ldquo;Well, it is 7:20 now. Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any
brains that God has given me? Quick, man, quick! It&rsquo;s life or
death&mdash;a hundred chances on death to one on life. I&rsquo;ll never forgive
myself, never, if we are too late!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down Baker
Street. But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big Ben, and eight
struck as we tore down the Brixton Road. But others were late as well as we.
Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was still standing at the door of the
house, and even as our foaming horse came to a halt the coffin, supported by
three men, appeared on the threshold. Holmes darted forward and barred their
way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take it back!&rdquo; he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the
foremost. &ldquo;Take it back this instant!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil do you mean? Once again I ask you, where is your
warrant?&rdquo; shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the
farther end of the coffin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The warrant is on its way. The coffin shall remain in the house until it
comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The authority in Holmes&rsquo;s voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters
had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders.
&ldquo;Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!&rdquo; he shouted as the
coffin was replaced upon the table. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one for you, my man! A
sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no questions&mdash;work away!
That&rsquo;s good! Another! And another! Now pull all together! It&rsquo;s
giving! It&rsquo;s giving! Ah, that does it at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid. As we did so there came from
the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform. A body lay
within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been soaked in the
narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the statuesque face of a handsome
and spiritual woman of middle age. In an instant he had passed his arm round
the figure and raised her to a sitting position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left? Surely we are not too
late!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For half an hour it seemed that we were. What with actual suffocation, and what
with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances seemed to have
passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with artificial
respiration, with injected ether, and with every device that science could
suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the eyelids, some dimming of a
mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life. A cab had driven up, and Holmes,
parting the blind, looked out at it. &ldquo;Here is Lestrade with his
warrant,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He will find that his birds have flown. And
here,&rdquo; he added as a heavy step hurried along the passage, &ldquo;is
someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we have. Good morning,
Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances the better.
Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who still lies in
that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
&ldquo;Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,&rdquo;
said Holmes that evening, &ldquo;it can only be as an example of that temporary
eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed. Such slips are
common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can recognise and repair
them. To this modified credit I may, perhaps, make some claim. My night was
haunted by the thought that somewhere a clue, a strange sentence, a curious
observation, had come under my notice and had been too easily dismissed. Then,
suddenly, in the grey of the morning, the words came back to me. It was the
remark of the undertaker&rsquo;s wife, as reported by Philip Green. She had
said, &lsquo;It should be there before now. It took longer, being out of the
ordinary.&rsquo; It was the coffin of which she spoke. It had been out of the
ordinary. That could only mean that it had been made to some special
measurement. But why? Why? Then in an instant I remembered the deep sides, and
the little wasted figure at the bottom. Why so large a coffin for so small a
body? To leave room for another body. Both would be buried under the one
certificate. It had all been so clear, if only my own sight had not been
dimmed. At eight the Lady Frances would be buried. Our one chance was to stop
the coffin before it left the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it
<i>was</i> a chance, as the result showed. These people had never, to my
knowledge, done a murder. They might shrink from actual violence at the last.
The could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she were
exhumed there was a chance for them. I hoped that such considerations might
prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene well enough. You saw the
horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had been kept so long. They rushed
in and overpowered her with their chloroform, carried her down, poured more
into the coffin to insure against her waking, and then screwed down the lid. A
clever device, Watson. It is new to me in the annals of crime. If our
ex-missionary friends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear
of some brilliant incidents in their future career.&rdquo;

<h3><a name="chap06"></a>The Adventure of the Dying Detective</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering woman. Not
only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and
often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity
and irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience. His
incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional
revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific
experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him
made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other hand, his payments were
princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price
which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I was with him.
</p>

<p>
The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with
him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem. She was fond of him, too,
for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He
disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent.
Knowing how genuine was her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story
when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of
the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying, Dr. Watson,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;For three days he
has been sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day. He would not let me get
a doctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face and his
great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. &lsquo;With your
leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour,&rsquo;
said I. &lsquo;Let it be Watson, then,&rsquo; said he. I wouldn&rsquo;t waste
an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need not say that I
rushed for my coat and my hat. As we drove back I asked for the details.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is little I can tell you, sir. He has been working at a case down
at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought this illness
back with him. He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon and has never moved
since. For these three days neither food nor drink has passed his lips.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God! Why did you not call in a doctor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have it, sir. You know how masterful he is. I
didn&rsquo;t dare to disobey him. But he&rsquo;s not long for this world, as
you&rsquo;ll see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the dim light of a foggy November day
the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt, wasted face staring at
me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart. His eyes had the brightness of
fever, there was a hectic flush upon either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his
lips; the thin hands upon the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was
croaking and spasmodic. He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight
of me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days,&rdquo; said he in a
feeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow!&rdquo; I cried, approaching him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand back! Stand right back!&rdquo; said he with the sharp
imperiousness which I had associated only with moments of crisis. &ldquo;If you
approach me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because it is my desire. Is that not enough?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right. He was more masterful than ever. It was pitiful,
however, to see his exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only wished to help,&rdquo; I explained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly! You will help best by doing what you are told.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He relaxed the austerity of his manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are not angry?&rdquo; he asked, gasping for breath.
</p>

<p>
Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight before
me?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your own sake, Watson,&rdquo; he croaked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For <i>my</i> sake?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what is the matter with me. It is a coolie disease from
Sumatra&mdash;a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though they have
made little of it up to date. One thing only is certain. It is infallibly
deadly, and it is horribly contagious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and jerking as he
motioned me away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Contagious by touch, Watson&mdash;that&rsquo;s it, by touch. Keep your
distance and all is well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, Holmes! Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs
with me of an instant? It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. Do you
imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so old a friend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you will stand there I will talk. If you do not you must leave the
room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that I have
always deferred to his wishes, even when I least understood them. But now all
my professional instincts were aroused. Let him be my master elsewhere, I at
least was his in a sick room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holmes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are not yourself. A sick man is but a
child, and so I will treat you. Whether you like it or not, I will examine your
symptoms and treat you for them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with venomous eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have
someone in whom I have confidence,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you have none in me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and, after
all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and
mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say these things, but you
leave me no choice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was bitterly hurt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes. It shows me very clearly the
state of your own nerves. But if you have no confidence in me I would not
intrude my services. Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or Penrose Fisher, or any of
the best men in London. But someone you <i>must</i> have, and that is final. If
you think that I am going to stand here and see you die without either helping
you myself or bringing anyone else to help you, then you have mistaken your
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean well, Watson,&rdquo; said the sick man with something between a
sob and a groan. &ldquo;Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you
know, pray, of Tapanuli fever? What do you know of the black Formosa
corruption?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never heard of either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological
possibilities, in the East, Watson.&rdquo; He paused after each sentence to
collect his failing strength. &ldquo;I have learned so much during some recent
researches which have a medico-criminal aspect. It was in the course of them
that I contracted this complaint. You can do nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly not. But I happen to know that Dr. Ainstree, the greatest
living authority upon tropical disease, is now in London. All remonstrance is
useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch him.&rdquo; I turned
resolutely to the door.
</p>

<p>
Never have I had such a shock! In an instant, with a tiger-spring, the dying
man had intercepted me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key. The next
moment he had staggered back to his bed, exhausted and panting after his one
tremendous outflame of energy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take the key from me by force, Watson, I&rsquo;ve got
you, my friend. Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise.
But I&rsquo;ll humour you.&rdquo; (All this in little gasps, with terrible
struggles for breath between.) &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only my own good at heart.
Of course I know that very well. You shall have your way, but give me time to
get my strength. Not now, Watson, not now. It&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock. At
six you can go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is insanity, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will go at six. Are you content to
wait?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I seem to have no choice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need no help in arranging the
clothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, there is one other
condition that I would make. You will seek help, not from the man you mention,
but from the one that I choose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered
this room, Watson. You will find some books over there. I am somewhat
exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a
non-conductor? At six, Watson, we resume our conversation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in circumstances
which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his spring to the door. I
had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed. His face
was almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to be asleep. Then, unable to
settle down to reading, I walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures
of celebrated criminals with which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my
aimless perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A litter of pipes,
tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other
<i>débris</i> was scattered over it. In the midst of these was a small black
and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing, and I had
stretched out my hand to examine it more closely, when&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It was a dreadful cry that he gave&mdash;a yell which might have been heard
down the street. My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that horrible
scream. As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and frantic eyes. I
stood paralysed, with the little box in my hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put it down! Down, this instant, Watson&mdash;this instant, I
say!&rdquo; His head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of
relief as I replaced the box upon the mantelpiece. &ldquo;I hate to have my
things touched, Watson. You know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond
endurance. You, a doctor&mdash;you are enough to drive a patient into an
asylum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind. The violent and
causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of speech, so far removed from
his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the disorganisation of his mind. Of
all ruins, that of a noble mind is the most deplorable. I sat in silent
dejection until the stipulated time had passed. He seemed to have been watching
the clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the
same feverish animation as before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Watson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you any change in your
pocket?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any silver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many half-crowns?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have five.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate, Watson! However, such as
they are you can put them in your watchpocket. And all the rest of your money
in your left trouser pocket. Thank you. It will balance you so much better like
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was raving insanity. He shuddered, and again made a sound between a cough
and a sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that
not for one instant shall it be more than half on. I implore you to be careful,
Watson. Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not draw the blind. Now you
will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within
my reach. Thank you. Now some of that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent,
Watson! There is a sugar-tongs there. Kindly raise that small ivory box with
its assistance. Place it here among the papers. Good! You can now go and fetch
Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13, Lower Burke Street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened, for poor
Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave him.
However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been
obstinate in refusing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never heard the name,&rdquo; said I.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly not, my good Watson. It may surprise you to know that the man
upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man, but a
planter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of Sumatra, now visiting
London. An outbreak of the disease upon his plantation, which was distant from
medical aid, caused him to study it himself, with some rather far-reaching
consequences. He is a very methodical person, and I did not desire you to start
before six, because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study.
If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique
experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest
hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I gave Holmes&rsquo;s remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to
indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those clutchings
of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was suffering. His
appearance had changed for the worse during the few hours that I had been with
him. Those hectic spots were more pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out
of darker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained,
however, the jaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always
be the master.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will tell him exactly how you have left me,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;You will convey the very impression which is in your own mind&mdash;a
dying man&mdash;a dying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think why the whole
bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures
seem. Ah, I am wandering! Strange how the brain controls the brain! What was I
saying, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it. Plead with him, Watson.
There is no good feeling between us. His nephew, Watson&mdash;I had suspicions
of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The boy died horribly. He has a
grudge against me. You will soften him, Watson. Beg him, pray him, get him here
by any means. He can save me&mdash;only he!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will do nothing of the sort. You will persuade him to come. And then
you will return in front of him. Make any excuse so as not to come with him.
Don&rsquo;t forget, Watson. You won&rsquo;t fail me. You never did fail me. No
doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures. You
and I, Watson, we have done our part. Shall the world, then, be overrun by
oysters? No, no; horrible! You&rsquo;ll convey all that is in your mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling like a
foolish child. He had handed me the key, and with a happy thought I took it
with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs. Hudson was waiting, trembling and
weeping, in the passage. Behind me as I passed from the flat I heard
Holmes&rsquo;s high, thin voice in some delirious chant. Below, as I stood
whistling for a cab, a man came on me through the fog.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is Mr. Holmes, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed in
unofficial tweeds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is very ill,&rdquo; I answered.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too fiendish, I
could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his
face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard some rumour of it,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
The cab had driven up, and I left him.
</p>

<p>
Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the vague
borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular one at which my
cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure respectability in its
old-fashioned iron railings, its massive folding-door, and its shining
brasswork. All was in keeping with a solemn butler who appeared framed in the
pink radiance of a tinted electrical light behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in. Dr. Watson! Very good, sir, I will take
up your card.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton Smith. Through
the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is this person? What does he want? Dear me, Staples, how often have
I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t see him, Staples. I can&rsquo;t have my work
interrupted like this. I am not at home. Say so. Tell him to come in the
morning if he really must see me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again the gentle murmur.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, give him that message. He can come in the morning, or he can
stay away. My work must not be hindered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the minutes,
perhaps, until I could bring help to him. It was not a time to stand upon
ceremony. His life depended upon my promptness. Before the apologetic butler
had delivered his message I had pushed past him and was in the room.
</p>

<p>
With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire. I
saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy, double-chin,
and two sullen, menacing grey eyes which glared at me from under tufted and
sandy brows. A high bald head had a small velvet smoking-cap poised
coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve. The skull was of enormous
capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amazement that the figure of the
man was small and frail, twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has
suffered from rickets in his childhood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he cried in a high, screaming voice.
&ldquo;What is the meaning of this intrusion? Didn&rsquo;t I send you word that
I would see you to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but the matter cannot be delayed. Mr.
Sherlock Holmes&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The mention of my friend&rsquo;s name had an extraordinary effect upon the
little man. The look of anger passed in an instant from his face. His features
became tense and alert.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you come from Holmes?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have just left him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about Holmes? How is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is desperately ill. That is why I have come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own. As he did so I
caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. I could have
sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile. Yet I persuaded
myself that it must have been some nervous contraction which I had surprised,
for he turned to me an instant later with genuine concern upon his features.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry to hear this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I only know Mr. Holmes
through some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for
his talents and his character. He is an amateur of crime, as I am of disease.
For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my prisons,&rdquo; he
continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which stood upon a side table.
&ldquo;Among those gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in
the world are now doing time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to
see you. He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in
London who could help him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why should Mr. Homes think that I could
help him in his trouble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is
Eastern?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among Chinese
sailors down in the docks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;is it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I trust the
matter is not so grave as you suppose. How long has he been ill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About three days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he delirious?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Occasionally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be inhuman not to answer his
call. I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this case
is certainly exceptional. I will come with you at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I remembered Holmes&rsquo;s injunction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have another appointment,&rdquo; said I.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes&rsquo;s address.
You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes&rsquo;s bedroom. For all
that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormous relief,
he had improved greatly in the interval. His appearance was as ghastly as ever,
but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a feeble voice, it is
true, but with even more than his usual crispness and lucidity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, did you see him, Watson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he is coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Admirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the best of messengers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wished to return with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would never do, Watson. That would be obviously impossible. Did he
ask what ailed me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told him about the Chinese in the East End.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. You
can now disappear from the scene.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you must. But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion
would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone.
There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Holmes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fear there is no alternative, Watson. The room does not lend itself to
concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion.
But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.&rdquo; Suddenly he sat
up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face. &ldquo;There are the wheels,
Watson. Quick, man, if you love me! And don&rsquo;t budge, whatever
happens&mdash;whatever happens, do you hear? Don&rsquo;t speak! Don&rsquo;t
move! Just listen with all your ears.&rdquo; Then in an instant his sudden
access of strength departed, and his masterful, purposeful talk droned away
into the low, vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man.
</p>

<p>
From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard the
footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the bedroom door.
Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken only by the heavy
breathings and gaspings of the sick man. I could imagine that our visitor was
standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer. At last that strange
hush was broken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holmes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Holmes!&rdquo; in the insistent tone of
one who awakens a sleeper. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear me, Holmes?&rdquo; There
was a rustling, as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; Holmes whispered. &ldquo;I hardly dared
hope that you would come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The other laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should imagine not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And yet, you see, I am
here. Coals of fire, Holmes&mdash;coals of fire!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is very good of you&mdash;very noble of you. I appreciate your
special knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our visitor sniggered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do. You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you
know what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! You recognise the symptoms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only too well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if it <i>were</i> the same. A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor
Victor was a dead man on the fourth day&mdash;a strong, hearty young fellow. It
was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an
out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London&mdash;a disease, too, of
which I had made such a very special study. Singular coincidence, Holmes. Very
smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause
and effect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew that you did it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn&rsquo;t prove it, anyhow. But
what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then
crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble? What sort of a game is
that&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man. &ldquo;Give me the
water!&rdquo; he gasped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re precious near your end, my friend, but I don&rsquo;t want
you to go till I have had a word with you. That&rsquo;s why I give you water.
There, don&rsquo;t slop it about! That&rsquo;s right. Can you understand what I
say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes groaned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the words out of my head&mdash;I swear I will. Only cure
me, and I&rsquo;ll forget it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, about Victor Savage&rsquo;s death. You as good as admitted just
now that you had done it. I&rsquo;ll forget it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. I don&rsquo;t see
you in the witnessbox. Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you.
It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It&rsquo;s
not him we are talking about. It&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fellow who came for me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten his
name&mdash;said that you contracted it down in the East End among the
sailors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could only account for it so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not? Think yourself smart,
don&rsquo;t you? You came across someone who was smarter this time. Now cast
your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no other way you could have got this
thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think. My mind is gone. For heaven&rsquo;s sake help
me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I will help you. I&rsquo;ll help you to understand just where you
are and how you got there. I&rsquo;d like you to know before you die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me something to ease my pain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Painful, is it? Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards the
end. Takes you as cramp, I fancy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes; it is cramp.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow. Listen now! Can you remember any
unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too ill to think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll help you. Did anything come by post?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By post?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A box by chance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fainting&mdash;I&rsquo;m gone!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen, Holmes!&rdquo; There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying
man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place.
&ldquo;You must hear me. You <i>shall</i> hear me. Do you remember a
box&mdash;an ivory box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it&mdash;do you
remember?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I opened it. There was a sharp spring inside it. Some
joke&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was no joke, as you will find to your cost. You fool, you would have
it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you had left me
alone I would not have hurt you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Holmes gasped. &ldquo;The spring! It drew blood. This
box&mdash;this on the table.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The very one, by George! And it may as well leave the room in my pocket.
There goes your last shred of evidence. But you have the truth now, Holmes, and
you can die with the knowledge that I killed you. You knew too much of the fate
of Victor Savage, so I have sent you to share it. You are very near your end,
Holmes. I will sit here and I will watch you die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holmes&rsquo;s voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Turn up the gas? Ah, the shadows
begin to fall, do they? Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the
better.&rdquo; He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened. &ldquo;Is
there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A match and a cigarette.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement. He was speaking in his natural
voice&mdash;a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew. There was a long
pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in silent amazement looking
down at his companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; I heard him say at last in a
dry, rasping tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,&rdquo; said
Holmes. &ldquo;I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither
food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water.
But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome. Ah, here <i>are</i> some
cigarettes.&rdquo; I heard the striking of a match. &ldquo;That is very much
better. Halloa! halloa! Do I hear the step of a friend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton appeared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All is in order and this is your man,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
The officer gave the usual cautions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,&rdquo; he
concluded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo;
remarked my friend with a chuckle. &ldquo;To save an invalid trouble,
Inspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up
the gas. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the right-hand pocket of
his coat which it would be as well to remove. Thank you. I would handle it
gingerly if I were you. Put it down here. It may play its part in the
trial.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron and a cry
of pain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only get yourself hurt,&rdquo; said the inspector.
&ldquo;Stand still, will you?&rdquo; There was the click of the closing
handcuffs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A nice trap!&rdquo; cried the high, snarling voice. &ldquo;It will bring
<i>you</i> into the dock, Holmes, not me. He asked me to come here to cure him.
I was sorry for him and I came. Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I have said
anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions. You
can lie as you like, Holmes. My word is always as good as yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Holmes. &ldquo;I had totally forgotten him.
My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies. To think that I should have
overlooked you! I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith, since I
understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have you the cab
below? I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be of some use at the
station.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never needed it more,&rdquo; said Holmes as he refreshed himself with
a glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet.
&ldquo;However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means
less to me than to most men. It was very essential that I should impress Mrs.
Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was to convey it to you, and
you in turn to him. You won&rsquo;t be offended, Watson? You will realise that
among your many talents dissimulation finds no place, and that if you had
shared my secret you would never have been able to impress Smith with the
urgent necessity of his presence, which was the vital point of the whole
scheme. Knowing his vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would
come to look upon his handiwork.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But your appearance, Holmes&mdash;your ghastly face?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three days of absolute fast does not improve one&rsquo;s beauty, Watson.
For the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With vaseline upon
one&rsquo;s forehead, belladonna in one&rsquo;s eyes, rouge over the
cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one&rsquo;s lips, a very satisfying
effect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon which I have sometimes
thought of writing a monograph. A little occasional talk about half-crowns,
oysters, or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of
delirium.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why would you not let me near you, since there was in truth no
infection?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you ask, my dear Watson? Do you imagine that I have no respect for
your medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute judgment would pass a
dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or temperature? At four
yards, I could deceive you. If I failed to do so, who would bring my Smith
within my grasp? No, Watson, I would not touch that box. You can just see if
you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a viper&rsquo;s tooth
emerges as you open it. I dare say it was by some such device that poor Savage,
who stood between this monster and a reversion, was done to death. My
correspondence, however, is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon
my guard against any packages which reach me. It was clear to me, however, that
by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might surprise a
confession. That pretence I have carried out with the thoroughness of the true
artist. Thank you, Watson, you must help me on with my coat. When we have
finished at the police-station I think that something nutritious at
Simpson&rsquo;s would not be out of place.&rdquo;

<h3><a name="chap07"></a>His Last Bow:<br/>The War Service of Sherlock Holmes </h3>

<p>
It was nine o&rsquo;clock at night upon the second of August&mdash;the most
terrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought already
that God&rsquo;s curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there was an
awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and stagnant air.
The sun had long set, but one blood-red gash like an open wound lay low in the
distant west. Above, the stars were shining brightly, and below, the lights of
the shipping glimmered in the bay. The two famous Germans stood beside the
stone parapet of the garden walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house
behind them, and they looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot
of the great chalk cliff in which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had
perched himself four years before. They stood with their heads close together,
talking in low, confidential tones. From below the two glowing ends of their
cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking
down in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
A remarkable man this Von Bork&mdash;a man who could hardly be matched among
all the devoted agents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had first
recommended him for the English mission, the most important mission of all, but
since he had taken it over those talents had become more and more manifest to
the half-dozen people in the world who were really in touch with the truth. One
of these was his present companion, Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of
the legation, whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was blocking the country lane
as it waited to waft its owner back to London.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be back in
Berlin within the week,&rdquo; the secretary was saying. &ldquo;When you get
there, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the welcome you will
receive. I happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work
in this country.&rdquo; He was a huge man, the secretary, deep, broad, and
tall, with a slow, heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his
political career.
</p>

<p>
Von Bork laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are not very hard to deceive,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A more
docile, simple folk could not be imagined.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said the other thoughtfully.
&ldquo;They have strange limits and one must learn to observe them. It is that
surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger. One&rsquo;s
first impression is that they are entirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon
something very hard, and you know that you have reached the limit and must
adapt yourself to the fact. They have, for example, their insular conventions
which simply <i>must</i> be observed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meaning &lsquo;good form&rsquo; and that sort of thing?&rdquo; Von Bork
sighed as one who had suffered much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations. As an example
I may quote one of my own worst blunders&mdash;I can afford to talk of my
blunders, for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes. It was
on my first arrival. I was invited to a week-end gathering at the country house
of a cabinet minister. The conversation was amazingly indiscreet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there,&rdquo; said he dryly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. Well, I naturally sent a résumé of the information to Berlin.
Unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these matters,
and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of what had been
said. This, of course, took the trail straight up to me. You&rsquo;ve no idea
the harm that it did me. There was nothing soft about our British hosts on that
occasion, I can assure you. I was two years living it down. Now you, with this
sporting pose of yours&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t call it a pose. A pose is an artificial thing. This
is quite natural. I am a born sportsman. I enjoy it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that makes it the more effective. You yacht against them, you hunt
with them, you play polo, you match them in every game, your four-in-hand takes
the prize at Olympia. I have even heard that you go the length of boxing with
the young officers. What is the result? Nobody takes you seriously. You are a
&lsquo;good old sport&rsquo; &lsquo;quite a decent fellow for a German,&rsquo;
a hard-drinking, night-club, knock-about-town, devil-may-care young fellow. And
all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the
mischief in England, and the sporting squire the most astute secret-service man
in Europe. Genius, my dear Von Bork&mdash;genius!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You flatter me, Baron. But certainly I may claim my four years in this
country have not been unproductive. I&rsquo;ve never shown you my little store.
Would you mind stepping in for a moment?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door of the study opened straight on to the terrace. Von Bork pushed it
back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. He
then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him and carefully
adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window. Only when all these
precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face
to his guest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some of my papers have gone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When my wife and the
household left yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with them. I
must, of course, claim the protection of the embassy for the others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite. There
will be no difficulties for you or your baggage. Of course, it is just possible
that we may not have to go. England may leave France to her fate. We are sure
that there is no binding treaty between them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Belgium?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and Belgium, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that could be. There is a
definite treaty there. She could never recover from such a humiliation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She would at least have peace for the moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But her honour?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. Honour is a mediæval
conception. Besides England is not ready. It is an inconceivable thing, but
even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think made our
purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of the
<i>Times</i>, has not roused these people from their slumbers. Here and there
one hears a question. It is my business to find an answer. Here and there also
there is an irritation. It is my business to soothe it. But I can assure you
that so far as the essentials go&mdash;the storage of munitions, the
preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements for making high
explosives&mdash;nothing is prepared. How, then, can England come in,
especially when we have stirred her up such a devil&rsquo;s brew of Irish civil
war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her thoughts at
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She must think of her future.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, that is another matter. I fancy that in the future we have our own
very definite plans about England, and that your information will be very vital
to us. It is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. If he prefers to-day we
are perfectly ready. If it is to-morrow we shall be more ready still. I should
think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them, but that is
their own affair. This week is their week of destiny. But you were speaking of
your papers.&rdquo; He sat in the armchair with the light shining upon his
broad bald head, while he puffed sedately at his cigar.
</p>

<p>
The large oak-panelled, book-lined room had a curtain hung in the further
corner. When this was drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound safe. Von Bork
detached a small key from his watch chain, and after some considerable
manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said he, standing clear, with a wave of his hand.
</p>

<p>
The light shone vividly into the opened safe, and the secretary of the embassy
gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeon-holes with which
it was furnished. Each pigeon-hole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced
along them read a long series of such titles as &ldquo;Fords,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Harbour-defences,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aeroplanes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; &ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Portsmouth forts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Channel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rosythe,&rdquo; and a score of others. Each
compartment was bristling with papers and plans.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Colossal!&rdquo; said the secretary. Putting down his cigar he softly
clapped his fat hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And all in four years, Baron. Not such a bad show for the hard-drinking,
hard-riding country squire. But the gem of my collection is coming and there is
the setting all ready for it.&rdquo; He pointed to a space over which
&ldquo;Naval Signals&rdquo; was printed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you have a good dossier there already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out of date and waste paper. The Admiralty in some way got the alarm and
every code has been changed. It was a blow, Baron&mdash;the worst setback in my
whole campaign. But thanks to my check-book and the good Altamont all will be
well to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I really can wait no longer. You can imagine that things are
moving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our posts. I
had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup. Did Altamont name no
hour?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork pushed over a telegram.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Will come without fail to-night and bring new sparking plugs.&mdash;A<small>LTAMONT</small>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sparking plugs, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see he poses as a motor expert and I keep a full garage. In our code
everything likely to come up is named after some spare part. If he talks of a
radiator it is a battleship, of an oil pump a cruiser, and so on. Sparking
plugs are naval signals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From Portsmouth at midday,&rdquo; said the secretary, examining the
superscription. &ldquo;By the way, what do you give him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Five hundred pounds for this particular job. Of course he has a salary
as well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The greedy rogue. They are useful, these traitors, but I grudge them
their blood money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I grudge Altamont nothing. He is a wonderful worker. If I pay him well,
at least he delivers the goods, to use his own phrase. Besides he is not a
traitor. I assure you that our most pan-Germanic Junker is a sucking dove in
his feelings towards England as compared with a real bitter
Irish-American.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, an Irish-American?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you heard him talk you would not doubt it. Sometimes I assure you I
can hardly understand him. He seems to have declared war on the King&rsquo;s
English as well as on the English king. Must you really go? He may be here any
moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have already overstayed my time. We shall
expect you early to-morrow, and when you get that signal book through the
little door on the Duke of York&rsquo;s steps you can put a triumphant Finis to
your record in England. What! Tokay!&rdquo; He indicated a heavily sealed
dust-covered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I offer you a glass before your journey?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thanks. But it looks like revelry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he took a fancy to my Tokay. He
is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things. I have to study him, I
assure you.&rdquo; They had strolled out on to the terrace again, and along it
to the further end where at a touch from the Baron&rsquo;s chauffeur the great
car shivered and chuckled. &ldquo;Those are the lights of Harwich, I
suppose,&rdquo; said the secretary, pulling on his dust coat. &ldquo;How still
and peaceful it all seems. There may be other lights within the week, and the
English coast a less tranquil place! The heavens, too, may not be quite so
peaceful if all that the good Zepplin promises us comes true. By the way, who
is that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Only one window showed a light behind them; in it there stood a lamp, and
beside it, seated at a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a country
cap. She was bending over her knitting and stopping occasionally to stroke a
large black cat upon a stool beside her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is Martha, the only servant I have left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The secretary chuckled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She might almost personify Britannia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with her
complete self-absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence. Well, au
revoir, Von Bork!&rdquo; With a final wave of his hand he sprang into the car,
and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot through the
darkness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the luxurious limousine,
with his thoughts so full of the impending European tragedy that he hardly
observed that as his car swung round the village street it nearly passed over a
little Ford coming in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
Von Bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the motor
lamps had faded into the distance. As he passed he observed that his old
housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired. It was a new experience to him,
the silence and darkness of his widespread house, for his family and household
had been a large one. It was a relief to him, however, to think that they were
all in safety and that, but for that one old woman who had lingered in the
kitchen, he had the whole place to himself. There was a good deal of tidying up
to do inside his study and he set himself to do it until his keen, handsome
face was flushed with the heat of the burning papers. A leather valise stood
beside his table, and into this he began to pack very neatly and systematically
the precious contents of his safe. He had hardly got started with the work,
however, when his quick ears caught the sounds of a distant car. Instantly he
gave an exclamation of satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe,
locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. He was just in time to see the
lights of a small car come to a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang out of it
and advanced swiftly towards him, while the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly
man with a grey moustache, settled down like one who resigns himself to a long
vigil.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Von Bork eagerly, running forward to meet his
visitor.
</p>

<p>
For answer the man waved a small brown-paper parcel triumphantly above his
head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can give me the glad hand to-night, mister,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bringing home the bacon at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The signals?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Same as I said in my cable. Every last one of them, semaphore, lamp
code, Marconi&mdash;a copy, mind you, not the original. That was too dangerous.
But it&rsquo;s the real goods, and you can lay to that.&rdquo; He slapped the
German upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from which the other winced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all alone in the house. I was
only waiting for this. Of course a copy is better than the original. If an
original were missing they would change the whole thing. You think it&rsquo;s
all safe about the copy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Irish-American had entered the study and stretched his long limbs from the
armchair. He was a tall, gaunt man of sixty, with clear-cut features and a
small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance to the caricatures of
Uncle Sam. A half-smoked, sodden cigar hung from the corner of his mouth, and
as he sat down he struck a match and relit it. &ldquo;Making ready for a
move?&rdquo; he remarked as he looked round him. &ldquo;Say, mister,&rdquo; he
added, as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the curtain was now removed,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t tell me you keep your papers in that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gosh, in a wide-open contraption like that! And they reckon you to be
some spy. Why, a Yankee crook would be into that with a can-opener. If
I&rsquo;d known that any letter of mine was goin&rsquo; to lie loose in a thing
like that I&rsquo;d have been a mug to write to you at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would puzzle any crook to force that safe,&rdquo; Von Bork answered.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t cut that metal with any tool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the lock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a double combination lock. You know what that is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; said the American.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get the
lock to work.&rdquo; He rose and showed a double-radiating disc round the
keyhole. &ldquo;This outer one is for the letters, the inner one for the
figures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as you thought. It was four years ago
that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and
figures?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I chose August for the word, and 1914 for the figures, and here we
are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The American&rsquo;s face showed his surprise and admiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My, but that was smart! You had it down to a fine thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, a few of us even then could have guessed the date. Here it is, and
I&rsquo;m shutting down to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ll have to fix me up also. I&rsquo;m not staying
in this goldarned country all on my lonesome. In a week or less, from what I
see, John Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping. I&rsquo;d rather
watch him from over the water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re an American citizen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, so was Jack James an American citizen, but he&rsquo;s doing time
in Portland all the same. It cuts no ice with a British copper to tell him
you&rsquo;re an American citizen. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s British law and order over
here,&rsquo; says he. By the way, mister, talking of Jack James, it seems to me
you don&rsquo;t do much to cover your men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Von Bork asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you are their employer, ain&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s up to you to
see that they don&rsquo;t fall down. But they do fall down, and when did you
ever pick them up? There&rsquo;s James&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was James&rsquo;s own fault. You know that yourself. He was too
self-willed for the job.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;James was a bonehead&mdash;I give you that. Then there was
Hollis.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man was mad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he went a bit woozy towards the end. It&rsquo;s enough to make a
man bug-house when he has to play a part from morning to night with a hundred
guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him. But now there is
Steiner&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork started violently, and his ruddy face turned a shade paler.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about Steiner?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve got him, that&rsquo;s all. They raided his store
last night, and he and his papers are all in Portsmouth jail. You&rsquo;ll go
off and he, poor devil, will have to stand the racket, and lucky if he gets off
with his life. That&rsquo;s why I want to get over the water as soon as you
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork was a strong, self-contained man, but it was easy to see that the news
had shaken him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could they have got on to Steiner?&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst blow yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you nearly had a worse one, for I believe they are not far off
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure thing. My landlady down Fratton way had some inquiries, and when I
heard of it I guessed it was time for me to hustle. But what I want to know,
mister, is how the coppers know these things? Steiner is the fifth man
you&rsquo;ve lost since I signed on with you, and I know the name of the sixth
if I don&rsquo;t get a move on. How do you explain it, and ain&rsquo;t you
ashamed to see your men go down like this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork flushed crimson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How dare you speak in such a way!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t dare things, mister, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your
service. But I&rsquo;ll tell you straight what is in my mind. I&rsquo;ve heard
that with you German politicians when an agent has done his work you are not
sorry to see him put away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you dare to suggest that I have given away my own agents!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t stand for that, mister, but there&rsquo;s a stool pigeon
or a cross somewhere, and it&rsquo;s up to you to find out where it is. Anyhow
I am taking no more chances. It&rsquo;s me for little Holland, and the sooner
the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork had mastered his anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of
victory,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done splendid work and taken
risks, and I can&rsquo;t forget it. By all means go to Holland, and you can get
a boat from Rotterdam to New York. No other line will be safe a week from now.
I&rsquo;ll take that book and pack it with the rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The American held the small parcel in his hand, but made no motion to give it
up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about the dough?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boodle. The reward. The £500. The gunner turned damned nasty at the
last, and I had to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it would have
been nitsky for you and me. &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;!&rsquo; says he,
and he meant it, too, but the last hundred did it. It&rsquo;s cost me two
hundred pound from first to last, so it isn&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;d give it up
without gettin&rsquo; my wad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork smiled with some bitterness. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have a
very high opinion of my honour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you want the money
before you give up the book.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, mister, it is a business proposition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. Have your way.&rdquo; He sat down at the table and scribbled
a check, which he tore from the book, but he refrained from handing it to his
companion. &ldquo;After all, since we are to be on such terms, Mr.
Altamont,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should trust you any
more than you trust me. Do you understand?&rdquo; he added, looking back over
his shoulder at the American. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the check upon the table. I
claim the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The American passed it over without a word. Von Bork undid a winding of string
and two wrappers of paper. Then he sat gazing for a moment in silent amazement
at a small blue book which lay before him. Across the cover was printed in
golden letters <i>Practical Handbook of Bee Culture</i>. Only for one instant
did the master spy glare at this strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he
was gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed
sponge was held in front of his writhing face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another glass, Watson!&rdquo; said Mr. Sherlock Holmes as he extended
the bottle of Imperial Tokay.
</p>

<p>
The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table, pushed forward his
glass with some eagerness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a good wine, Holmes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon the sofa has assured me that
it is from Franz Josef&rsquo;s special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace. Might
I trouble you to open the window, for chloroform vapour does not help the
palate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front of it was removing dossier
after dossier, swiftly examining each, and then packing it neatly in Von
Bork&rsquo;s valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a
strap round his upper arms and another round his legs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We need not hurry ourselves, Watson. We are safe from interruption.
Would you mind touching the bell? There is no one in the house except old
Martha, who has played her part to admiration. I got her the situation here
when first I took the matter up. Ah, Martha, you will be glad to hear that all
is well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway. She curtseyed with a smile
to Mr. Holmes, but glanced with some apprehension at the figure upon the sofa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is all right, Martha. He has not been hurt at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad of that, Mr. Holmes. According to his lights he has been a
kind master. He wanted me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday, but that
would hardly have suited your plans, would it, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, Martha. So long as you were here I was easy in my mind. We
waited some time for your signal to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the secretary, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. His car passed ours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought he would never go. I knew that it would not suit your plans,
sir, to find him here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed. Well, it only meant that we waited half an hour or so until
I saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear. You can report to me
to-morrow in London, Martha, at Claridge&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you have everything ready to leave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir. He posted seven letters to-day. I have the addresses as
usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, Martha. I will look into them to-morrow. Good-night. These
papers,&rdquo; he continued as the old lady vanished, &ldquo;are not of very
great importance, for, of course, the information which they represent has been
sent off long ago to the German government. These are the originals which could
not safely be got out of the country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then they are of no use.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should not go so far as to say that, Watson. They will at least show
our people what is known and what is not. I may say that a good many of these
papers have come through me, and I need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy.
It would brighten my declining years to see a German cruiser navigating the
Solent according to the mine-field plans which I have furnished. But you,
Watson&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped his work and took his old friend by the
shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hardly seen you in the light yet. How have
the years used you? You look the same blithe boy as ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feel twenty years younger, Holmes. I have seldom felt so happy as when
I got your wire asking me to meet you at Harwich with the car. But you,
Holmes&mdash;you have changed very little&mdash;save for that horrible
goatee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These are the sacrifices one makes for one&rsquo;s country,
Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes, pulling at his little tuft. &ldquo;To-morrow it
will be but a dreadful memory. With my hair cut and a few other superficial
changes I shall no doubt reappear at Claridge&rsquo;s to-morrow as I was before
this American stunt&mdash;I beg your pardon, Watson, my well of English seems
to be permanently defiled&mdash;before this American job came my way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you have retired, Holmes. We heard of you as living the life of a
hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the South
Downs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly, Watson. Here is the fruit of my leisured ease, the magnum opus
of my latter years!&rdquo; He picked up the volume from the table and read out
the whole title, <i>Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some Observations
upon the Segregation of the Queen</i>. &ldquo;Alone I did it. Behold the fruit
of pensive nights and laborious days when I watched the little working gangs as
once I watched the criminal world of London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how did you get to work again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I have often marvelled at it myself. The Foreign Minister alone I
could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble
roof&mdash;! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit
too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going wrong,
and no one could understand why they were going wrong. Agents were suspected or
even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. It
was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to
look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been
devoid of excitement. When I say that I started my pilgrimage at Chicago,
graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the
constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate
agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realise that
the matter was complex. Since then I have been honoured by his confidence,
which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his
best agents being in prison. I watched them, Watson, and I picked them as they
ripened. Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself, who after much gasping and
blinking had lain quietly listening to Holmes&rsquo;s statement. He broke out
now into a furious stream of German invective, his face convulsed with passion.
Holmes continued his swift investigation of documents while his prisoner cursed
and swore.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Though unmusical, German is the most expressive of all languages,&rdquo;
he observed when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. &ldquo;Hullo!
Hullo!&rdquo; he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before
putting it in the box. &ldquo;This should put another bird in the cage. I had
no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though I have long had an eye
upon him. Mister Von Bork, you have a great deal to answer for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and was
staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his captor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall get level with you, Altamont,&rdquo; he said, speaking with slow
deliberation. &ldquo;If it takes me all my life I shall get level with
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old sweet song,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;How often have I heard it
in days gone by. It was a favorite ditty of the late lamented Professor
Moriarty. Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been known to warble it. And yet I
live and keep bees upon the South Downs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse you, you double traitor!&rdquo; cried the German, straining
against his bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, it is not so bad as that,&rdquo; said Holmes, smiling. &ldquo;As
my speech surely shows you, Mr. Altamont of Chicago had no existence in fact. I
used him and he is gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then who are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is really immaterial who I am, but since the matter seems to interest
you, Mr. Von Bork, I may say that this is not my first acquaintance with the
members of your family. I have done a good deal of business in Germany in the
past and my name is probably familiar to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would wish to know it,&rdquo; said the Prussian grimly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was I who brought about the separation between Irene Adler and the
late King of Bohemia when your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial Envoy. It was I
also who saved from murder, by the Nihilist Klopman, Count Von und Zu
Grafenstein, who was your mother&rsquo;s elder brother. It was I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork sat up in amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is only one man,&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa. &ldquo;And most of that information
came through you,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What is it worth? What have I done?
It is my ruin forever!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is certainly a little untrustworthy,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;It
will require some checking and you have little time to check it. Your admiral
may find the new guns rather larger than he expects, and the cruisers perhaps a
trifle faster.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are a good many other points of detail which will, no doubt, come
to light in good time. But you have one quality which is very rare in a German,
Mr. Von Bork: you are a sportsman and you will bear me no ill-will when you
realise that you, who have outwitted so many other people, have at last been
outwitted yourself. After all, you have done your best for your country, and I
have done my best for mine, and what could be more natural? Besides,&rdquo; he
added, not unkindly, as he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate
man, &ldquo;it is better than to fall before some ignoble foe. These papers are
now ready, Watson. If you will help me with our prisoner, I think that we may
get started for London at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he was a strong and a desperate man.
Finally, holding either arm, the two friends walked him very slowly down the
garden walk which he had trod with such proud confidence when he received the
congratulations of the famous diplomatist only a few hours before. After a
short, final struggle he was hoisted, still bound hand and foot, into the spare
seat of the little car. His precious valise was wedged in beside him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit,&rdquo; said
Holmes when the final arrangements were made. &ldquo;Should I be guilty of a
liberty if I lit a cigar and placed it between your lips?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But all amenities were wasted upon the angry German.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you realise, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
if your government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of
war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about your government and all this treatment?&rdquo; said Holmes,
tapping the valise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a private individual. You have no warrant for my arrest. The
whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kidnapping a German subject.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And stealing his private papers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you realise your position, you and your accomplice here. If I were
to shout for help as we pass through the village&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge
the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us &lsquo;The Dangling
Prussian&rsquo; as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient creature, but at
present his temper is a little inflamed, and it would be as well not to try him
too far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a quiet, sensible fashion to
Scotland Yard, whence you can send for your friend, Baron Von Herling, and see
if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the
ambassadorial suite. As to you, Watson, you are joining us with your old
service, as I understand, so London won&rsquo;t be out of your way. Stand with
me here upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever
have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes, recalling once
again the days of the past, while their prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the
bonds that held him. As they turned to the car Holmes pointed back to the
moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an east wind coming, Watson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think not, Holmes. It is very warm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age.
There&rsquo;s an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on
England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may
wither before its blast. But it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s own wind none the less, and
a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has
cleared. Start her up, Watson, for it&rsquo;s time that we were on our way. I
have a check for five hundred pounds which should be cashed early, for the
drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can.&rdquo;
</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
